yeah i know a little more about civil cases when than criminal cases which is [laughter] it's more in how you present it versus you know who's right
yeah
i'm sure of it because a lot of those things it's all it's in it's largely a matter of viewpoint and who can argue their case better
yep [laughter]
[laughter]
um it's kind of weird
i don't know yeah i always think about watching the people's court or something
[laughter]
and how weird those cases get
i know
it's just [vocalized-noise]
when i was uh couple of years ago involved in some pretrial stuff and like you know you go say okay we can't bring up this point because then they're gonna you know the opposition will say this this and this and
yeah
um-hum and it's like boy the stuff that they can twist around is it's pretty amazing
[vocalized-noise]
yep [laughter]
and it's like the the truth really isn't important anymore it's
yeah it's not
[laughter]
and then you get people who who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because like this this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious and he really gets into suing people
yep
[laughter]
and so he'll he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court and argue his case
[laughter]
you know it's like
that sounds like a little abuse of our system but [laughter]
it is it's it's wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else but uh
yeah but it's for the more general people don't want to take responsibility
yeah
you know that's a
and uh and and most of the time they're looking to place blame um
yep [laughter]
and stuff see you're from california is that right
uh yeah well originally chicago but
hum
oh okay i was just thinking i wonder i wonder how how the civil system or the the court systems differ between there and say where i am in minneapolis
i mean from what i understand it's all pretty much the same except when you get to louisiana
i- i rea-
[laughter]
and louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the what is it it's based on common law and the rest of the country is not or something like that it's pretty strange
oh
yeah
but uh
fortunately i never have had to go in even even for jury duty
yeah i haven't either other than
but um
that friend of mine's telling me that i might have to go in for uh as a witness he may subpoena me
[laughter]
so we'll see what happens
but uh
yeah i'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better i
yeah it's there are too many big problems you know there's there's such a backlog of court cases right now
i know [laughter]
you know to try to get them all in in a good time
and we already have too many lawyers as it is
yeah and if it's criminal cases we you can't put them in jail because there's no room left
yeah
yeah that's true and in fact they're even letting some go i'm i'm o- i'm originally from florida and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just because they don't have room for them
yeah
um
you know that's not a that's not a good solution either
not at all
so i'm not real sure what to
[noise] -kay randall uh uh do you have any special interest in uh space flight
[noise]
oh yeah [vocalized-noise] ever since i was a young and uh used to watch the old uh apollo missions going off in uh classroom t._v.s
uh-huh
uh i suspect a lot of people uh uh got uh turned on by watching watching those go off uh very exciting
[laughter]
um-hum
yeah
the uh
uh i've al- i've always uh w- wanted very much uh to uh be somehow involved in all that
um-hum
and uh to uh meet and and to see see it actually happen of course i've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday
um-hum
but uh that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately
[laughter] what do you do now
uh computer programmer
oh
[laughter]
unfortunately that can be done from the ground [laughter]
yeah
to bad uh [laughter]
yeah made the wrong wrong career choice to get up into space
[laughter]
[noise]
the uh
uh
i used to think when i was when i was younger that uh by this time we'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now
um-hum um-hum
uh
frustrating at times
um-hum
i don't know what you think [laughter] about all that
well uh yeah i uh [vocalized-noise] i'm kind of young i'm only twenty two and so uh
[noise] uh i'm not you know there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as uh you know with the space shuttle and all
although plans to uh go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to uh the sixties
uh-huh
um although i have a [noise] i- i kind of wonder [vocalized-noise]
uh if
some if it were possible to market some uh form of uh space technology you know to uh
uh to make it equitable it might severely help the economy you know in the in the
uh respect that [noise] you know there's endless amounts of research to be done endless amounts of resources and and what not it would be great if we could find some way to to uh use that to boost the economy
yeah
well
yeah well the uh
uh
i've always uh felt that uh uh one of the long term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have uh some sort of uh solar power satellites up
um-hum
uh because that's a uh you know in singularly renewable resource that doesn't do it that doesn't require uh uh any particularly uh nasty environmental impact
exactly
and you can just get as much power as you need up there it's a matter of how big you build it
um-hum
um-hum
uh and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have uh lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no [vocalized-noise] things that i think we should be doing
so the side effects of doing that which i think would be good y- know very very good for all for everyone in the long run is uh is it some of the other things i'd like to see happen would happen also
right yeah it seems like uh there's uh so you're talking about positive side effects then okay i understand
so
i'm
yeah right right um
sure th- that makes a lot of sense
right the only problem is of course that uh that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there
um-hum
yeah
and they want to do the research and uh they're all [noise]
yeah
you know n- no one the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like uh the trip to mars
right exactly
which is would would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth but
[noise]
the same money could probably be far better spent on uh uh lunar bases and solar power satellite research an- and uh and uh so forth
um-hum
it it would be do- it would be being done for the uh glitz and show factor
um-hum
to get politician's votes instead of instead of f- for you know we should eventually send someone people to mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so
right
we should do it because [vocalized-noise] for the for the return we get for it and uh
um-hum
uh unfortunately that's not why things happen [laughter]
exactly
i- i would settle for the glit- [vocalized-noise] for the glitz if the side effects were useful if they oh but uh
least nothing
yeah
the downside of that is that you after you do one of those people say well we did it
right now we're done
now let's now we're done [laughter]
[laughter]
no need to use this anymo- to play around with this space stuff anymore that's what happened with apollo
yeah i think you're right
uh
but uh
i'd give almost anything to get into space [laughter]
i would too i'd i'd uh it was it john denver that that tried to buy his way on to the space shutt-
[noise]
anyway i guess there was just somebody recently down there was- today in texas was it or there was uh
[noise]
i'm not
put to death
uh i'm not sure there was the big one uh earlier in the week in uh california that o- on and off and on and off [noise] um
um in california yeah
yeah so how do you feel about it
about capital punishment
i- i don't know i'm [noise] i'm uh mixed views on it i d- i don't
think that it really does much good as it as a deterrent uh the old thing in in terms of uh the the the uh biggest day for pickpockets was at the when they were hanging pickpockets but in public but uh
um-hum
uh on the other hand it it the it seems like that there just aren't are uh
some crimes and and some lives that that that there's no other at least emotional reaction to it what about you
yeah
well i've you know i- i kind of like you there's c- certain crimes that i think it fits i'm for it generally speaking i think the thing that bugs me the most about it is that
the process itself gets so drug out and so
[noise] you know i understand you need to prove without a shadow of a doubt that the guilt and whatnot but the appeal process of it i think is what really bugs me if you're gonna make it go so long you know what's the use of it
yeah
it almost becomes more more co- you know to much cost and more trouble than it's worth you know to to put somebody like that to death or something that you know
yeah
rather than just sentence him to life and forget all the hassle you don't have to pay the attorneys all those fees they get and whatnot because i feel like you know sometimes it gets too drug out but
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think i am i am basically for it with if you know if the crime of course fits it because some of those people this you got to wonder will they ever do anything i mean
yeah
[noise] right right that that there's just
[noise]
uh the time just comes that pure and simple you know you got to wonder if they're just a plain and simple menace to society or they gonna
[laughter]
right right
ever reform but
[noise] right well now d- does uh uh
utah have capital punishment
yes we do uh-huh and i and it's been a c- there was a oh it's been about fourteen years now there was a pretty hideous murder
in a hi-fi shop where they murdered one person and they they the two people that did it they poured drano down one guy's throat and they kicked a pen through another guy's ear and and all kinds of things like that and and of cour- a couple of them ended up dying and a couple didn't but
um
ah one of the kid one of the two men involved was uh was was uh put to death oh about two years ago a- and like i said if it took about thirteen years for it to happen and the other guy is still sitting on death row you know fourteen fifteen years later
um
yeah
and that's why you know like i say a part of my thing with the whole appeal process kind of bugs me because here they have sat for you know fifteen years and i- i wonder about the families of the people who are the victims you know and they've got to be a little bit upset themselves and
[noise] yeah that th- that's i- and uh that that [noise] i- if it's gonna happen it seems like there there there's some sort of closure when it when it's over and done with i know that was one of that
um-hum
aspects that covered the sequel to the case in california was was both i- this is the first one in twenty five years and they've got something like over three hundred [vocalized-noise] on
uh-huh
death row but the other thing was whe- you know the family of the victims uh one of the fathers of the boys i think in california but you know wanted to be there to to witness it and it didn't feel like the whole thing was over and that's been fourteen years too i think [noise] and uh
uh-huh
yeah that's true yeah they uh
uh oh i for- i lost my point but yeah that's like i say i think the the victims and just if that's gonna happen they they just wanna have it done and over with but you know i agree there's got to be some appeal process because
it's almost you you wanna make sure in that situation that the person really did commit the crime uh you wanna give him every opportunity you possible can but uh
yeah
[noise] well that's the that's the thing here in here i- here in texas we've had a couple of cases in the last [noise] one one was a was a murder case where it was
[noise]
um-hum
at this point it's fairly obvious that it was a tha- a a girl was killed at a high school and it was pretty obvious that the
police just picked out the black janitor and and uh set him up for it and uh he really didn't have anything to do with it and they [laughter] that certainly makes you think a- again and yeah yeah [noise] and uh
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that's that's the scary part especially something like this
i know in uh you know this california case the uh the civil lib- or a._c._l._u. i guess the american civil lib- you know they were doing anything they could to prevent it even to going as far as uh
yeah
you know stating the gas chamber is not uh as cruel or is cruel and unusual punishment and in such that they just drag up any little thing they possible can to drag it out or or whatnot you know i mean
yeah
well now in uh in utah what's the method it is it firing squad or what huh
they u- firing squad is is what's used a firing squad yeah
yeah that's what i was thinki- [vocalized-noise] wasn't there a a big case
[noise] okay um i haven't been in this situation yet
[noise]
you know my my parents are not quite at that age yet so i haven't
that's not quite elderly huh
no so i haven't uh really been in that situation although they are thinking about my grandmother but um
[laughter]
uh-huh
that's really about it how about you have you been in that situation where you've had to
um not for my parents but i- i was around uh two sets of grandparents
um quite a bit we we put one i put one grandfather in a rest home
uh-huh
and
that killed him [laughter] well yeah kind of well there was some other things involved but it before he was really active and
did it really
the there was some you know he lo- lost his drivers license and uh couldn't get around and wasn't able to do some things and so we ended up just having to put him in a rest home
yeah
and he just kind of became a vegetable and died
oh no that's sad
so but that was a long time ago that was uh back in like seventy three
[noise] yeah
oh okay
so um i think the way they did things were a lot different back then
are sure they were
and uh
my grandmother his his wife uh we also put her in a rest home she was in a rest home and then she was back out because she didn't really need to be there
yeah
uh-huh
and uh had a physical had a good physical therapist at that place
oh
and they worked with her and
got her walking and got her ta- kind of taking care of herself and so she was able to come back home
yeah
oh
and then she had to go back in a couple of times
but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up
huh
and they got her going again
yeah
so i guess as far as looking and i said the as what you're looking for i think you need to look for an active
uh
[vocalized-noise] interactive staff
uh-huh
somebody who's willing to work with uh you know work with a patients and do do things with them and treat them treat them like that
yeah [noise]
and i'm sure it's it's expensive
it it is [laughter]
yeah
[noise]
yeah
it is expensive
yeah my my grandmother is not in a nursing home but she's in a [noise] oh they're like um they're apartments for senior citizens
what
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
and she loves that because i- i- they arrange activities for them all day long and then they have um where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go
um-hum
and she she she really does love that but she's just concerned about
i-
in the future you know she she knows it's not gonna be like that all the time and she's just wondering well what's gonna happen to me and and i you know it's i guess it's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she doesn't need that but
uh-huh
when she can't take care of herself
um-hum now th-
you know she's kind of asking questions about what well what's gonna happen you know this can't last forever and
uh-huh
so [noise]
does she have a is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to or she can go down to the cafeteria
yeah i-
yeah she can but i- i think it is also cafeteria style because i- i really i- i- i doubt if she rarely cooks for herself
uh-huh
so uh
fact i
because i- i remember her in her letters telling me she she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat so i'm assuming it's something like that too so
uh-huh
so
yeah i- i really like that concept they've they have a few of those well quite a few of those places like that here in utah and uh you know i
um-hum
couples can you know husband and wife can can live there too or or whatever i and an- and then and yet they have their their friendships and relationships the [noise]
you know of getting together and eating together and all of that
[noise] yeah yeah
i- i think it really takes um
y- you know looking more at the people than even really the facilities
um-hum and she lives by herself too she seems to like it and um my husband's grandmother is
uh-huh
well she lives she lives in a house on her own and she doesn't really need the care or anything like that but she has her own home and sh- and she's doing really well i'm really proud of her she's doing really well
um-hum
so
we haven't had to do anything but then again she has a lot of support so i mean she's got her mother in town too and things like that so hopefully we won't need to go that route [noise]
yeah
yeah
well i- i think that that's the thing that's a little bit scary you know a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it's it's almost like that you know they say putting them out to pasture
and some some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active they they wanted to do things they didn't you know they didn't wanna go down and play bingo or um
yeah
you know play with the yarn
[noise] what do you think about capital punishment
[noise]
well i'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes
yeah which crimes do you feel that
well
i think first degree murder um
probably warrants it
yeah because mo- so many times that's so brutal and just recurrent
right
felons i think should also
exactly recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever
yeah
i come from a state that has well i originally come from a state that has uh
the death penalty i come from florida and uh they're pretty liberal on it they tend to like fry people left and right which go ahead
uh-huh
yeah that's a
go ahead texas is too texas i saw on t._v. the other night is the has had forty six in like the past several years
yeah
so they're pretty
hip on it too i guess they do it by lethal injection at huntsville
yeah okay i think florida still uses electric chair
yeah
um i don't i don't know in some ways i don't like it because it's like you're playing god
yeah
and that's not you know i don't think that's right but on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it i think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it
yeah
and of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not
yeah
um with florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year they
yeah that's what's happening here there is like um that's in fact a big gubernatorial issue is the the turn over rates of
um-hum
um re- uh repeat offenders being let out and doing it again
sure and it's like you know that's a big problem but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build
um-hum
and it's really you know it's it gets to be a a rea- a big problem
yeah
um go ahead
i wish if th- if they were gonna do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't be a little more you know not being able to put it off for fifteen years
right
um-hum yeah because a lot of these guys you know they get in and they they get off for good behavior
and i don't know i mean up in minnesota where i am now they don't have the death penalty and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system
you know because they figure well you know sure i- i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something um
but then for if i if i elicit good behavior i'm out in maybe five or ten
oh really
oh sure you know i mean just because like we said before they don't have enough room in the jails um you know there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early
goodness
um-hum
yeah
but if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head um
i don't know i think that may solve a lot of that maybe not solve it but
yeah
i don't know maybe even help a little bit
i yeah i tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little little too lenient um kind of takes away
yeah
from the significance of the death penalty
um-hum what do you do georgeanne
i'm a graduate student at the university of texas in dallas
oh okay great what program you in
um audiology
okay fantastic uh i'm a doctoral student at university of central florida
yeah what do you do
oh really
yeah i'm doing an internship up at honeywell
oh really neat
uh yeah
but um
i don't know it's it's an interesting issue there's like you say in texas there's been quite a few and and in florida in the last few years
i think there's been a lot i can't i [vocalized-noise] i mean i can't give you figures but um
yeah
i just an- this was in conjunction with a guy that was put in the gas chamber [noise]
in california so i- i think it the forty sixth in last twenty five years i think it's what they gave a run down that texas
uh-huh
oh is that right
okay
texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then
yeah i- i kind of yeah i've heard things about that i've heard that they don't mess around very much yeah
yeah um they they don't get repealed as easily as they do
um-hum
like i- the guy in california got thir- you know twice before he went to the gas chamber and then they said okay no you don't have to go and then they took him back i mean it just seems
jeez that's a lot of repeals
yeah it just seemed a little inconsistent and then you had like who you have
these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back whenever you know
um-hum
yeah i don't know i i'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it uh i guess what is it what's the policy now with treason do they uh do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence i
no i don- i don't think um the military doesn't execute anymore so
yeah
or death before the firing squad or whatever
yeah
so i think about the only one is um
rape
okay um
[noise]
read any good books lately
[laughter]
uh yes i i've read uh several good books lately uh
lot of them uh related to um
business and financial matters since that's what i do for a living
oh okay um-hum
how about yourself
uh well i'm in graduate school and so i read a lot of books but i don't know if i consider very many of them good [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter] um
i haven't read a book for enjoyment since i guess around christmas um [noise] i re- received uh
uh several books for christmas and at christmas break i read uh sarum by uh uh a fellow named rutherford
yes
uh it's the history of um well it's s- sort of the his- the historical fiction about uh the salisbury area in in england
um-hum
uh and so uh i i really enjoyed that book a lot uh he's not quite as good as you know michener or some of uh some of the other historical writers but he he did his job well so
yeah
well that sounds good
uh
do you find i- uh do do you find you have much chance to read for for just pleasure or mostly for business
no i read for pleasure some also i read a book recently called iron john have you seen that by bly
um-hum
i don't think i have seen it
okay well it's a book about uh
uh greek gods and and greek um mythology
uh-huh
as well as uh men and interacting with other men and a book about uh men and how they mature through life
um-hum
and how they deal with life itself
oh
okay i think i have heard about that
yeah
but it's uh it's all revolved around uh mythology
uh-huh
uh as far as uh traditions from uh other cultures and our culture
um-hum
and how we uh interact with one another
um-hum
yeah that sounds great did did it have something to mention about um sort of uh cultural rituals of of manhood
yes
okay yeah i have heard of that i have uh
someone suggested that i read it is it iron john
yes
okay good
by bly b. l. y. i believe it is
b. l. y. okay
um-hum
great
and uh it's a very interesting book
uh-huh
uh what are your favorite
uh
do you have a favorite subject to read whether it be science fiction or or history or
well it depends again if we're talking about uh
um i read a lot of religious books
um-hum
uh just because i have an interest in that area
um-hum
and i read a lot of books in the area of uh um psychology and self help type uh materials
um-hum
okay
uh always trying to understand people better and understand myself in a relation to other people and try to understand where the people are coming from because i'm in a people business
um-hum
um-hum
okay
and uh so th- th- that that's my work is my hobby
um-hum that's
[laughter] so i i enjoy it
sounds great [laughter]
um uh who is your uh [vocalized-noise] who is your favorite religious author
well i don't know if i have a favorite
uh-huh
uh religious author
i would have to say that uh
some of the ones that consistently put out good materials
uh
you know that that's difficult because
one person might write one book rea- extremely well and some other ones might not write as well
um-hum
uh i have to stop here and think a second
one of the ones that i've read recently that i've read several of his books and i thought that each one of his books were good
he's the man out of san antonio
and uh max lucado
max lucado
yeah
max co- consistently writes good books
yeah uh he's a great man i've met him several times uh
yes i i know him yeah
uh
[vocalized-noise]
uh
but uh there's other authors also that have uh
uh that write good books from time to time but not consistently put out the materials all the time
um-hum
um i'd say another which is a local writer here in plano
um is
i'm trying to think of his name he's with the bible church
and that is uh
i see his name but i can't i mean i see him but i can't see his name
[noise]
but he uh he talks about uh he talks about a lot of different topics and dimensions of the church and
um-hum
[vocalized-noise] start it
[noise]
sure
okay uh basically i work for the government and our health insurance plan seems to be okay but it seems the benefits are are eroding and the cost of insurance goes up
uh i don't know why the post people post office people pay one third out of their paycheck for the same insurance that we're getting
uh right now i'm in we're physicians health plan and that costs about thirty five bucks a paycheck
but yet the postal people will only pay less than ten dollars a paycheck
it's called the union [laughter]
yes probably yes full payment one percent and i'm sure not everybody has they're probably getting their [vocalized-noise] worth and
[noise]
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise] mastercard's cheaper too
well
i am all for universal health insurance um being up here in new york um
our local blue cross blue shield people have
i'm i'm now paying every month because i'm self-employed one hundred and three dollars a month
for basic health care coverage
um actually i'm sorry it's more than th- well it's four hundred dollars a quarter
um-hum
[noise]
so it's probably a little more than that
gosh yeah that's a steep one
and
[noise]
frankly i don't i think that if we can take what's been done in canada and given every body a choice as far as who they want for their health care
frankly i think that the reason that we're in so much trouble and and and it's such an anticompetitive um
uh stance right now as far as doing battle with these other companies is that we are really burdening our american corporations with health care costs which they have to build in to the price of their product
whereas if you go to so- one of these overseas countries japan for example where the government pays all of that
um-hum
the you don't have to build that in to the cost of the product um they usually nail the pr- you know you pay as as an individual
versus um having a company dragged down by these insane health care costs
and i think that we should have a health care system in this country that everybody can get access to and uh have it universal
i agree there because i you know saturday afternoon you're playing baseball and you break your arm you don't know what it's going to cost you for the x-rays and everything else like that if you don't have some type of health plan that you can afford
and i'm sure there's a lot of people that live paycheck to paycheck to where they cannot [vocalized-noise] and afford fifty bucks every paycheck for a health insurance plan
and i know i and when i was in germany i was in the service but at the same time there was an agreement that if you went to a hospital there in germany that they knew they could bill uncle sam for that hospital care
so they didn't give us any hassle [vocalized-noise] medical care there
and my brother and my dad are over there and it's a great health insurance plan for them
[vocalized-noise]
[noise]
i think that's going to cost us money as far as taxes if our government gets into it because they all haven't shown a real good record for management of any kind of program
yeah yeah i you know i- i wouldn't even mind so much if they had a um corporation that is financed
through the government or have some sort of there can be competition as long as there is a universal plan i don't opp- i do not i'm not for eliminating all private health insurance whatsoever
but um you know but if if you have the ability to pay
for that you can pay based on your income as a percentage
and uh more fairly and equitably distribute the cost across a wide spectrum right now
you know the people working this country is half the problem right there and we're seeing that's not a lot of it is private sector too
um i you know it's the government is always attacked for not being able to do anything properly
[vocalized-noise]
this is one example i don't think the private sector's doing much better though
i'm pretty ignorant on taxes but on self-employed do you get any kind of credits for health insurance
i get a credit this year and last year because the government specifically said i could get a credit
but the uh but it is it's going to expire which means i'm paying uh i get a sum a sum uh sum of the money back
but um not all of it of course um
i'm in a worst off position than someone who is employed who gets their health health care taken care of by their employer
um because i have to also obtain my insurance from is a third party middle man type deal
i have to go to go the small business service bureau and pay eighty dollars a year just for the right to buy health insurance
[laughter]
works well for them but it's horrible for me
um
you know the consumer is going to pay in the end no matter what happens so
yeah i- i- i- i
[vocalized-noise] cost hidden or not
you just can't it's just it's sky rocketing i mean we're seeing increases every year ten to fifteen percent
and you know it's it's gotten way out of hand and the- and then you have these [vocalized-noise]
[noise] he uh well do you use a budget
[noise]
uh i do at times off and on right now i'm probably in one of the more the more off times
any particular reason uh that you get off of it or does it seem to work for you
oh it works fine it's just i- i think sometimes i you know you get busy you slack off a little bit and then
you know there's no more uh i mean you know then it's work to catch up
yeah
uh you know then the two or three times where i've got to the point i really needed one i created one and stuck by it
and you do stick by it when you do it huh
yes how about you
[laughter]
well i tend to have a monthly budget and basically what it is i list all my income coming in and the expenses and whatever's left over i spend
hm
you know i just [laughter]
that just kind of seems to be the way it works
the budget i stuck on the most
pardon me
was the the budget i was on the most was what was called the ten twenty seventy budget
and
and basically ten percent of your income goes to uh
uh long-term savings
um-hum
twenty percent goes toward
uh basically short-term you know doing going out to dinner
like going to the movies uh maybe you know saving that part up toward like going on you know so- something a l- little more short-term than like the long-term budget
and then the o- and then seventy percent goes toward uh uh you know paying debts and and and that kind of stuff with the whole idea being that you pay yourself first you're more likely to stick with it
yes and i know th- that theory unfortunately neither i'm marr- married and neither my husband or myself have the greatest amount of self-control in the world
hm
and uh so that makes it pretty easy not to stick with the budget at times you know instead of thinking oh we'll save it this month we'll think well oh gee we'll buy this lamp or this whatever you know
sure
so uh our s- our savings plan sometimes goes down the drain
but are you married
uh i will be a week from next monday
oh do you think this is going to change the way you budget your money in any way
no not really
have you kind of discussed this already with your fiancee
yeah yeah so far for now i think uh i mean for now we've still got our own money really
uh
and that'll probably it'll probably be that way till uh you know we like buy our own house together or something
uh-huh
in which case you know it's very convenient to once again throw everything together
uh
well i agree it's uh
maybe for us anyway it's easier just to to put it all in one big pot and not worry about who makes what or who you know who donates what to it
right right
but uh but we just kind of started out that way and
yeah a- and right now in my case it's more situation that uh that she uh
uh has still got a lot of debt
and it's easier for me to kind of like just shoulder
oh
the normal stuff
uh-huh
and let her concentrate on getting herself out of debt
well that's a good idea do you think this is true of all women i seem to have been in debt when my husband and i got married too
[laughter]
well i was the year before and that was the last time i really got on a budget was to really fight being in debt because i didn't like it
uh no it's not a whole lot of fun
so
[laughter]
i think it's people in general
yeah you have a tendenc- that's a tendency to do it when you can
uh
one of the ways i insure my long-term savings is the fact that you know i've got a 401k plan so i've got
uh five percent of my income going into that uh that's actually five percent before taxes
um-hum
um-hum
uh that cou- you know so that's even more and then i've also uh
uh you know got a few other miscellaneous automatic deductions
which i think is really the easiest way to save because once you have the money in your hand in the check you'll think oh well i just won't put anything
yeah
abso-
or you know even if it's of course most of us are direct deposit anymore anyway i'm sure but once it goes into the checking account it's awfully hard to transfer it over
right well i've i've even got a uh fifty dollar a month uh uh mutual fund automatic transfer on the twentieth of every month
that's a good idea
you know once again you know you know it's there you know it's going to happen
it's a uh
an easier way to uh
to save
um-hum
and uh your fiancee i- she'll she goes along with the savings part too even though uh she's managed to get herself into debt
no she has no saying [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter] but you're going to manage to make her stick to your plan right
well sure you know you know like you said for right now we really kind of each have our own money which is maybe a weird way to do your budgeting but
[laughter]
um-hum
i i think until you know we're we're both growing [vocalized-noise] because you know of that i think it'll probably stay away for awhile
well actually i know some people a a girlfriend of mine who was married probably about three three or four years ago and they still have separate checking accounts that's the way they prefer it uh
you know uh she doesn't go into detail as to why they prefer it that way or anything but it's everybody as long as i think uh your
right
okay
[noise]
um
i'm i'm not to familiar with the topic because uh i haven't been in that situation i guess [laughter] but i watch a lot of the documentaries on t._v. and that kind of thing it always kind of interests me
i had to run close the door so i didn't hear the whole thing
and
oh okay about um
penalty and trials and that kind of thing if it should be left up to the judge or trial by jury or to the people that kind of thing
[noise] well i think it's uh the way it is is probably uh
pretty good as far as the uh you know some of them are i believe you uh the defendant has a
chance to request trial by jury if they want
yeah
and i guess uh
and there are some cases that go to the judge
um and i think the topic was
like um should it be that way or should it be
um
up to the people or
um
i think
well i uh again i think it's uh
i think the defendant should have a choice there if he wants a trial by jury and then uh with the option of letting you know allowing the judge to try it
that's
yeah
some cases it
you know
probably doesn't require a full jury
i would assume it would take more of the taxpayers' money for it to go through trial by jury but sometimes it seems like it comes out the outcome comes out the best
yeah exactly that
some- in in most cases it comes out the best when it's trial by jury but i i could see where it could take up a lot of um the community's money that way rather than just leaving it up to the judge
you think it uh it always comes out the best with a jury
i'd say for the most part not you know it's it's it's hard it really is but i
um-hum
what about the fact that uh a jury may be six people in some cases but um
uh maybe they're not you know
one reason or another just
maybe you get a bad bunch or what ever and they uh
yeah you can you can
but it seems like when i- when it's trial by jury it's a little more detailed it's a little more slower and um
i don't know you it's uh it it requires a little bit more thinking
um-hum
um -quires a little more research that kind of thing so that's why i say it probably mo- in most cases i would think it would co- the outcome would be better in most cases not always but uh
yeah
i tell you what the to-
al- along those lines a little more exciting topic is what the uh
the uh criminal uh punishment panel is uh reviewing in austin right now
uh-huh
now which is uh
reducing a rape case without a firearm or without a weapon to uh just practically a misdemeanor
oh really
yeah
[noise]
actually they call it a fi-
hum
fifth fourth or fifth degree felony which is [laughter]
can't ev- you know be no jail time
right right
and uh [noise] and of course the hottest topic of the day along jurisprudence lines is the uh
the early release of prisoners at least down here in houston it is
yeah i heard about that yeah
yeah that's that's real scary you know i i i just think things are there's a lot of changes right now that are going on and it's getting to be where it's really it's just real scary
um-hum
um i don't know but then again i guess it takes up a lot of your taxpayers money and time
and um i don't know it's just it's
i don't know that's a hard one you know
[laughter]
yeah it's jus-
well i uh [noise] they sure need to do something
um-hum
with uh
you know early release there's a uh
as far as letting them out
when you have five percent of your capacity is still available i think they're uh they're just they're just con- too concerned with prisoners rights and not enough concern for victim's rights you know
do you feel that that's worth
yeah
right i they had a uh a documentary tha- on that on uh do you ever watch forty eight hours
i mean uh
yeah
they had something very similar to that and uh
and that's real scary too you know i mean
to to really think about it really is
well there's a there's a bill been passed last year that uh
would allow
i don't know exactly where these beds are but there's some i guess they tap in like hospital beds and all and
what the uh intent is to is lump them in with the actual prison beds they have and and that way thereby increasing the uh capacity immediately
[noise] i guess what
[noise]
this brings to mind is uh um my chief complaint is then uh
the priority that's given to kids
[laughter]
that's what comes to mind anyway
how do you mean
[laughter]
well i don't know i guess uh i think one of the biggest changes that's taken place over the last twenty five years anyway is um uh
uh both parents working and the
um-hum
the uh mechanisms haven't really been in place to get to give kids all the attention they need
yeah
so i think that uh and i think we're sort of reaping the
um results of that in uh
the consequences [laughter]
a lot of problems yeah i mean i don't blame people for um both going to work um both parents going to work
[noise] it's tough not to for a lot of people
[vocalized-noise]
[noise] but it's been i think that may be the single
biggest social change in the middle class anyway that's uh that has uh
uh had a lot more repercussion that people every thought
yeah yeah my wife and i have gone through a couple of decades together we're both on our early forties
um
um [noise] we've been married uh twenty two years
so we sort of grew up together and um just had children uh so we have a four year old and a two year old
um-hum
and uh for the first eighteen years of our marriage um we were two income you know careers and all that so we had a pretty full lifestyle and
um-hum
and having the children we decided to uh to go into one income so i work and she stays home
tough isn't it
and and it's you know the
the ideal value system is is to motivate it there
our si-
because it it certainly is something that uh
that we thought long and hard about
our situation is very much very similar um
mary [vocalized-noise] we're both professionals and [vocalized-noise] used to working
and we decided that when we had kids that we would uh have somebody home until they were uh well into school
um-hum
it's difficult espec- it's not so much
difficult financially i don't think as it is uh culturally
in that it's um
uh kind of expected i thi- i think it's difficult on my wife not to be um
um-hum
professionally identified and that sort of thing
um-hum
but i really feel like it's been worth it for the kids and when i look around i think uh i'm i'm pretty glad we made the decision we did
yeah yeah we've you know experienced a lot the the turmoil of the uh the sixties and seventies
and uh
[noise] i think we we were part of that um
looking for new value systems and having uh [noise] a vision of the way the world was going to be when we were you know in middle age which i guess we are now
and then all of the sudden the kids come along
[vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah that too but uh i just think that uh
right now we're experiencing a lot of disappointment with uh our generation and and uh
the way things haven't really changed and i think that uh you know our personal
difficulties are reflected in a lot of the unrest right now we're seeing with respect to politics
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
yeah i- i think uh
you have to be
um i don't want to make it uh melodramatic but you have to be kind of cultural really if you want to put your family first and uh
um-hum
um to sort of uh put a cap on things that you can really have and enjoy and just go ahead and uh
um do what's right by your by your family
yeah
[noise] and i don't i- i don't see a lot of support out there i see
a lot of people um
voting down school taxes and um
um-hum
uh well a degree of the eighties was i think uh maybe the most disappointing social phenomena that i witnessed
yeah
because i really did see i- living in dallas you see it you see it in um magnified about twenty times
[laughter]
yeah i mean uh maybe double that again in the east coast
really
uh yeah [vocalized-noise] and we- we're both from the mid west we're both from saint louis and uh experienced [vocalized-noise] but we spent the entire eighties out here and uh
um
we're just thirty miles outside of manhattan
um-hum
and uh it's very different than the mid west it's
i guess the [vocalized-noise] i guess the financial world was kind of the epicenter of that uh
yeah yeah i mean uh you know the the kids around here
stuff in the eighties
uh you know think they're poor if they can't get a polo shirt every week [laughter]
um-hum right
it it's it's a different perspective and uh you know we got caught up in that we we we had you know a real decade of hay day
[vocalized-noise]
an uh now we're retrenching like a lot of the rest of the country
[vocalized-noise]
uh particularly because you know we chose to have a single income and um
um
also i work in uh in a large corporate setting and that has become unsettled in the last
[noise] do you have any thoughts on company benefits
i do but uh they're pretty slanted i want you to know [laughter]
i'm prepared
[laughter] uh my company was bought by another company
um-hum
and the majority of us were laid off
oh okay i see where this is going
uh-huh so you know uh what i would like to see
well uh the really sad part of this is that i'm fifty five years old
that's not that bad
and
beg your pardon
that's not so sad
oh my chances of getting another job are just really slim
hm
i was a systems analyst for an oil company
right
and you know they just i mean sprint had uh two thousand jobs open i mean i'm sorry two hundred jobs open they had two thousand applications
for this type of work you know it's just uh and i guess that's that's pretty far-fetched as benefits go
uh-huh
but gosh you know i saw it i was fixed for life [laughter] so uh
i think more and more people are finding that out even people with state and and uh federal jobs it it's a shock
it really is it really is
but uh i- i think uh i guess my feelings on this are that the one of the most important benefits we currently have is our health insurance
that's true
and that if there were some way to get that to follow you from job to job
or so that you would not lose it if you have to leave a company
isn't there some sort of deal where you can continue your benefits for eighteen months
there is uh-huh and and that's fine but you know i'm still unemployed after about fourteen months okay
oh yeah that's worrisome
and when you switch yeah when you switch over the the premiums are really quite high
and additionally i've had a heart attack
um
so it's going to be really tough for me to do this so you know uh in in my very personal way i feel that insurance is just one of the most important benefits we have now
now with the poli- political situation the way it is i think that's going to change
you talking about national health
because
i think we're going to have to have something of that sort
um
so that will cease to be as important a benefit
i think that well i think the whole thing with this health insurance being so high is because people are
what are your feelings what what do you feel
suing left and right and just driving these costs up
well i agree with you but do you know that's that's what makes this such a tremendous benefit if you can possible get group rates
well i- i have my own beef about health insurance i uh
i'm not a spring chicken myself quite frankly um i raised a family and
[laughter]
now i'd like to get back into my field which is teaching and it's at a time where school budgets are so far down that they're firing experienced people
and also you know i'm i'm a art teacher which is a very small field out of a whole school there's two or three
oh yes
uh-huh
and you know there are two hundred apliplations for one one job uh you send in a resume and th- they don't even write a letter to you to say no thanks which
yep
they they don't have time
yeah i suppose and um i do substitute teach and my biggest complaint is schools get a discount insurance school districts because they have so many people
why can't they allow their substitutes to buy into it to pay ourselves just to get the lower rate that a group would have and they won't let us
well you've you've approached it
yeah they don't let you do it
what is their thinking on it
uh um i don't know i don't know
have they said
i just i just know it's not allowed
okay have they said we cannot do this because
yeah uh no not th- they didn't get that far
no because
no because we we do we don't do this
we don't do this and everybody thinks it's sort of a crying shame i have been divorced and i knew that uh when i was divorced i was allowed that eighteen months of insurance on my ex-husband's plan and i was allowed to pay for myself
okay
uh-huh
at their lower rate and i don't see what the school district would have to lose by letting us pay for ourselves but
is uh let's see
are they paying a part of the premium
well i they're paying all the premium for their full-time teachers
oh they are
yeah yeah that's part of their salary
and have you offered to come in and have you offered to come in and pay the whole premium
yeah
and they still won't let you
no no it's just not policy
that's crazy
yeah that just doesn't seem to make any sense
so what do you do about insurance
well i am remarried now and my husband um quit his job to try some consulting he's an engineer
and what he did was he j- you know if you join a group sometimes it's a little less he joined the engineer's society or some group like that and what he did which was actually very clever most people want to have
ah yeah
the lowest deductible and then get eighty percent of their money back and all of this my husband said why don't we take a five hundred dollar deductible
if we have a little you know annual checkup here or there we can pay that that's not the prob-
so how do you feel about it
uh i- i- i don't see any problem with with ra- testing for random drugs
yeah i- i myself almost um am in favor of it uh
i work at honeywell and i went through a a pretty i don't know i went through a standard drug testing thing before i i was brought on
um-hum
i think that's pretty standard at least at honeywell it is um i think it's important to insure the quality and
and uh
i don't know almost the goodness of character you know and that kind of thing where do you work
yeah
um well i'm a graduate student right now at carnegie mellon and i i just came from saint paul uh interviewing with three m.
oh okay oh okay
hm
oh great
and uh they have a policy for uh testing i- if you if they make you an offer then they'll test you right before you start
right
and i guess the only
drawback i can see to to drug testing is in in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some uh sort of false positive result
um-hum
then there could be some sort of problem but uh i-
yeah
yeah and that that definitely happens you know i mean those the drug tests assure u- they're accurate but there's always that margin of error
yeah
and that's that's something to be aware of
another thing is a lot of times you know they aren't that accurate or they aren't that sensitive like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they gonna do about that [laughter]
yeah [laughter]
you know i was on a couple of different prescription drugs when i was tested for honeywell and uh
uh you know i know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something
um i'm sure they screen for just a particular few types although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for
right
um i don't know what what program are you in over at carnegie mellon
uh electrical engineering
oh okay great um
yeah i'm a graduate student at u._c._f. in florida university of central florida and this is actually a [laughter] an internship up here
oh wow
[laughter]
but um
they uh even for interns they they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing so
uh th- they test you um before they before you start or before you even interview or
right
um they essentially no i sure don't um they essentially um
they essentially uh made me the offer and then and then uh
did the drug testing thing after that
so uh it was one of those things where you go through the the general battery of all their tests and and then they essentially give you the offer
uh-huh
and then at that point they'll they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that
oh
so uh there's some noise on this end i'm actually in a mall calling so
oh [laughter] yeah
[laughter] you probably wondered huh
but so
wha- what happens if you were to fail then do they give you like one ch- one more chance or two more chances
yeah that's a good question i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave uh if you fail i believe they give you one more chance they probably give you a chance to explain yourself
um-hum
and then maybe give you another chance to go through it
but uh you know once again those things are not that accurate so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail you know but um wha- are you working right now anywhere or
uh no i'm just about to finish my masters in may and uh just interviewing with companies right now
okay
oh okay great
yeah that was the first time i'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening you know was was going to honeywell a friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there and he's doing an internship with i._b._m.
um-hum
oh
and uh
they basically uh did the same exact thing um we both got our internships at the same time and we both had to go through drug tresting at the same time so one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process but uh
do do they test you at right now at work too
no no that's one thing they don't do is is drug testing while you're on the job uh i think i think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it but they don't do it
okay
oh [laughter]
you know so
that's good i guess i don't know i mean
i uh
i have gone to a couple of parties since since that time and while i don't do any drugs myself i've seen some people who work there um
you know smoking a joint or whatever and uh
um-hum
you know that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up
you know but
no they don't they don't really do that
wow is it formal policy that they said that they might test
yeah
[noise]
[noise]
so interesting political trends or events huh
um-hum
well i guess the uh most interesting one that's uh going on right now from my perspective is this uh phenomena of um [noise] uh ross perot
uh caught his interview last night with david frost and it was the the first time i had you know heard um you know his views expressed by himself i had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in
uh-huh
uh-huh
but the whole phenomena of him coming out of uh literally no where no party um at least no apparent party support on either side
[noise] is pretty interesting
huh
yeah i have not even heard uh believe it or not of that person i'm not kidding when you when you said it it was kind of like a surprise
um-hum
like out of nowhere yeah
yeah i think mainly because i haven't been watching what's politically going on um in that a- you know
um-hum
in that aspect uh as far as like now the new health bill that went through minnesota uh being that it is their neighboring state and that i lived in minnesota and more familiar with the politics that involved with that and that being passed
um-hum
but um as far as politics in the grander uh
part of it as if you want to look at uh election type things i'm not quite sure even if i'm going to vote uh
um-hum yeah
i- it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up like that to make the decision on who would be the best to run um
um-hum
[noise] well it seems that the decisions so far has been filtered by uh you know party politics so much that when the candidates finally get party approval party support and therefore get presented to the public
um-hum
sure
exactly
the the candidates are already beyond what uh most public uh feels is acceptable behavior
um-hum
you know the one of the common criticisms of clinton is uh gee he'll say or do anything in order to get to the white house and and up unto the point of uh perot being a serious candidate it seems like that
sure
that was a requirement of being a a contender within the party is is to have done all those things
um-hum sure
i mean here's a here's a guy who for twenty years has been working toward you know getting the party nomination and and preparing himself for the presidency
and now it seems like both he and the incumbent president are you know pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of
a whole nonpolitical arena
he might be a a one of those sure uh it it's kind of when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer
uh when you think of some of the best presidents we've had in the past have been people that have struggled to get to the top i mean they were not rich in in any means
um-hum
and it has been kind of in the past uh i don't know maybe fifty years that in order for a person to get i- involved with politics they've had to have money
um-hum
and you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way um
um-hum
so it makes the common person uh not to say that a common person couldn't run for government and do a a fabulous job because he's got people that are quite intelligent and
i don't know if we'll ever see that you know where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and uh has
um you know you think of abraham linking lincoln and you know just th- the background of abraham lincoln you know teaching himself to read he didn't go to college he didn't
um-hum
you know do all the other things that um you know you would think that was real popular to do and to get po- politically involved and and have money he didn't come from money um
um-hum yeah
a- and yet even he was a a consummate politician in the sense that uh not only did he f- uh fail in business twice with bankruptcy and and failure but he lost some eighteen elections before he finally won one
and now it it
um-hum sure
um-hum
and the first e- first and only election he won was um the presidency
[laughter]
[laughter] he he had lost every other office that he had you know he was appointed a couple of times to uh like uh [noise] uh state legislator
so you really know a lot of his background
yeah then when then when he finally you know did win an election uh you know was the presidency yeah
it was the big one it's the one that everybody wants yeah whether or not uh you know you look at all these candidates that want to become president i really have to ask them why you know um
[noise] yeah
but
yeah
it's the toughest job in the world to do and not only that you don't have that much freedom to make choices i mean you have to go through so many different you got to go through the house the congress and all of the a other things to get a bill passed
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum
um-hum
and sure you can veto uh veto it at the last minute but then it's not like you have all that power and i think along time ago presidents did have a lot of power and i think we're
um-hum
[noise] okay uh okay so our subject is nursing homes um do you have any experience or any uh opinions on what to do i do
[noise]
i do have actually as a matter of fact uh and i'm i'm not sure how it would relate to the big city but there are certainly ways and humane and and nice ways of handling care for our elderly
i come from a very small community in northern iowa and the churches have banded together and built and staffed a retirement home
um-hum
that's wonderful
[noise] and the care of course is is wonderful because these are all people who care
um-hum
and every week the churches a different uh groups of the churches volunteer and come in and maybe have bingo day or special celebration day or help someone with their birthday or whatever
and it makes the care very personalized of course but since it is a small community everybody knows everybody and so there there would be n- absolutely zero chance of any abuse
um-hum
um-hum
[noise] that's great because uh
you know i think that is probably a persons greatest fear and i'm not faced with this yet but my mother is seventy three she's in good health and living by herself but um
i'll probably be faced with this you know sometime in the next few years as to what to do when mom gets to the point that she can't take care of herself
um
unfortunately having her come live with us you know if she needs constant care is not going to be an option and what do you do you know
yeah it's it's a real problem um it is a real problem and i know that everybody hates the idea of going to one of these but i also think that
it is a choice that we have all made in our lives as we have drawn back and internalized ourselves as opposed to being a part of the community
um-hum
uh it used to be that neighbors looked out for you the churches looked out for you but many of us don't belong to churches any more
um-hum
and so therefore we don't have this broadened community of caring people
and we don't have the nuclear family that we used to have many many years ago either
no
no absolutely not you know i presume when when the time comes for something to happen to me that i will probably go back to iowa to be in that community
but uh
[noise] well it's good that you know that you have that option available um th- because i don't think that too many communities have something like that set up
but it's the type of thing where i think we should look at some things that are working and try to use them in the cities also
um-hum
i mean is there some reason why some of the churches here could not band together and do a similar situation
probably not
um and it might even be easier here in that there are so many more churches available more people to draw from
yes
and actually a great deal more money [laughter]
well yes that's for certain my my mom lives in a small town also and i know you know the funds just aren't available uh to do something in a small town that you have that you can do in a larger town
but um uh you know other than care conditions you know i don't know really what else a person looks for uh convenience for the family would be a a wonderful thing
uh but th-
that's you know that's not always an option either
right but you know if my f- if all of my kids still live here and i go back to iowa course there is no convenience so probably it would behoove me [laughter] to try to start something of this sort here in dallas
um-hum
[noise] but uh
that's a big job you know uh
so many needs are crying the homeless the abused children the the beaten wives you know there's so many things going on that that how do we all of this
and maybe that's a part of it maybe maybe what we can do is uh
[noise] of course this is kind of a far flung situation but uh you know they're talking about work fare now in uh wisconsin i believe it is
but is there some reason i wonder why we couldn't have some of these people involved in nursing homes
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum
is that
so that they didn't have to be so expensive you know if y- if you've got somebody who is drawing welfare then perhaps that can be quote part of their their payment for their welfare payments
um-hum
well and i think that would be a good idea too i don't know if these people need it for self-esteem it would seem to me that they would but if nothing else yes let them earn some of their money
yeah because part of the problem now is that [noise] it costs so much money to get into a convalescent home
or or an aged home
um-hum
you know it's almost prohibited for many persons and uh you know so what do you do does someone go on welfare in order to get in one of those homes
or does somebody in the family quit their job so that they can be at home a- and but of course that's not always wonderful either because somebody with alzheimers needs twenty four hour watching and nobody can do that
um-hum
that's right that's right i well i guess that's probably as people get older f-
nobody can do that
[noise] have you any thoughts
[noise]
well you called here so
okay well um
[noise] i'll tell you i am uh uh impressed with the uh uh amount of spending that's occurred so far as as far as aids research and i think that uh proportionately
maybe uh so far it's been enough it seems like it seems like uh
but there's not [noise] uh been any money taken away from uh other necessary medical research uh
uh subjects uh
you know and and allocated towards the aids research i think that aids research has been a a a lot of the funding has not been done by the government a lot of it has been done by private endowment
uh but i think the government is doing a good job so far
of keeping the uh their portion of the funding up
well i um i agree to an extent um i think the problem is is that
we're spending money and one of the things that the government likes to do when they're under public pressure is to throw money at the problem
um-hum
in an attempt to try and solve it as quickly as possible and they did that with the pentagon in the eighties [laughter] and when you have a lot of money in your budget and you don't wanna have it cut back you spend it even if it means throwing it away
um-hum
right
and i think that while we need to spend more effort and money on things like education and maybe even alternative treatments and alternative ex- things to keep those afflicted alive at this point
um-hum
i think that any money that is given must be given carefully just to something that is a proven point not just thrown at it
um-hum
um i- i don't see that the money is being removed from any other causes um
aids has been a problem though especially in the eighties
when there wasn't a lot of private dollars around because of the stigma of the disease
uh-huh
and that people really didn't groups didn't wanna be associated with it because it was a morals issue
right
i think we're finally getting over that i thought that was ridiculous reading and hearing about that kind of moral dilemma stuff but [noise]
i think that it we need to spend a lot more on education and try and get over this thing that we have about
not confronting this head on with some factual advertising for items of condoms and things like that that
um-hum
will help prevent the uh disease as well as instilling the notion that the best way not to get it is not to involve yourselves in unsafe practices in the first place [laughter]
exactly um it although i was uh i- i was shocked at the public um uh outrage uh that occurred after after i uh think it was dan quayle who said um
you know who suggested that maybe maybe we [vocalized-noise] you know maybe that is a a possible and and uh
uh likely most effective solution is you know abstinence and and yet the a large portion of the community said well that's stupid you know that just shows that you have no interest in in in spending any money on the on the problem and i thought
th- th- th- th- that's not that's not the point at all
well the the problem is that with this administration at least when they say abstinence
they often couch that in other things that turn into one of these morals issues
which uh makes it turn into a political issue now you see the problem is you have people in the national institutes of health in atlanta and the like the centers for disease control which
um-hum
have fundamentalists in charge of the thing who won't even let you say condom in a meeting
right
and these things have been spread around and i- immediately people think well abstinence okay here we have these religious zealots telling us
where they're trying to ignore the problem blah blah blah and of course they overreact when you say that the fact that it's just good medical safe practice you know don't expose yourself in the first place
um-hum
um-hum
but the it's because th- th- the you know this administration was around when reagan when the disease first was discovered here and all the social you know implications of the reagan administration ignoring it when it first became an issue and
um-hum
see that's all carrying over now
right
and that's why you're seeing that
okay that that makes a little bit of sense uh i- i hadn't i was not aware that that was uh such a a within the n._i._h. that uh that was that much uh [noise]
[noise]
yeah there is because what happened is a lot of these people and staff members are political appointees
um-hum
from the south especially who come along with a variety of different religious beliefs
some of which held very fervent beliefs
and will take their beliefs into the workplace in and in this case a lot of people consider that to be standing in the way of science and medicine to try and solve this thing
um-hum
um-hum
but i i don't like throwing money at the problem uh bec-
[noise]
[noise] um well i'm just really excited about it because i'm graduating from college next month and i hope to be buying a car sometime [laughter] in the future
uh-huh
so so hopefully uh maybe do you have any good advice do you have a car or
[noise]
uh yeah i do have a car
um-hum
uh right now i have sort of a sporty car it's a subaru that i- it's called an xt6 i don't think they make them anymore i think i have the last year
uh-huh
and it's one of these japanese cars that run without needing many repairs um
um-hum
my advice about cars is uh get a good engine get something that goes not because i'm a speed freak uh something because if you want to get on a highway you don't want to step on the gas and and say come on come on
um-hum
that's true that's true
i do you know [noise] they make jokes about women picking out the color but i really do like to have a decent sized engine in my car
[laughter]
and i have a six cylinder and it does go when i tell it to and and i just like the looks of a kind of sporty car
um-hum
uh i think my car needs are going to change i had very small children and i was saddled with a station wagon that i never wanted
oh
um i was told that you know it'll hold groceries and all this stuff well the grocery bags fell over in a station wagon
that's true they do my mom has one
you know a- and you know and i wasn't that thrilled to put a bike in it or a dog in it and i didn't so when i got a new car i got a sporty little car and my kids were still small enough but they weren't in baby seats anymore and they sat in the back
um-hum
and now my son is fourteen and a half and he's taller than i am and every time i go over a bump he crashes his head because
oh
oh no [laughter]
you know these cars have they're backseats but they're kind of toy backseats
yeah yeah
[laughter] so i think should i get another car uh much to my chagrin it'll have to be something more boxy
um-hum
and you know practical again so this i g- i guess this is my reprieve and i guess my suggestion to you is to get something you really enjoy because at some later date you'll have to get something more practical
[laughter]
that's great advice i'm so glad i got to talk to you that's good that's what i needed to hear [laughter] yeah i guess
[laughter]
i'm looking for uh something kind of small because it's only me and i'm a small person i'm only about five one [laughter] so
uh-huh
um and i'd like to get something made in the united states so i would look for that first but
if it turns out that a better price is from say japan like the subarus then i i would go for that because the most important thing is price i mean because
well you know the more i think of it you know with what's going on in the world nowadays i think the next car i would try to buy an american one
um-hum
would you really
yeah i think so it's you know toyotas and all those they- they're nice cars but you know surely there's an american car i i'd love to check out the saturn which is supposed to be a new newly made american car
yeah
you would think so
um-hum actually i heard really good things about them and uh it's funny because i just spent last weekend i was down in washington d._c. visiting my sister and they are everywhere down there it's amazing because you hardly see any of them on the road here in philadelphia but i saw about ten in one weekend
and uh my sister had gone to the dealership and she was really impressed she uh the one thing that really impressed her which sounds kind of weird but they actually have women salesmen
it's weird because i mean have you ever seen a woman car salesman
oh yeah i have
really because i was surprised but and she said they were really nice and
one good thing about the car is it's really hard to dent you know when you're driving a car and you you go in a p- yeah you know most cars in a parking lot like a c- shopping cart hits it or a car door hits it and you have like these dents well the lady took a hammer to this car and it didn't dent
is it really
huh
she was like smashing it and it didn't [vocalized-noise] it's it's made of something i don't know what it is but
really how was the pricing
it's actually supposed to be really good the smaller ones i think around are eight thousand and then it gets up to maybe twelve thousand
oh that's that's not horrible at all that's quite good nowadays
so they they look really nice
yeah yeah so i don't know maybe that's something to think about because they're supposed to be completely made in the united states not one of these deals where
yeah
it says it's made in the united states but the engine is really made in japan and all the parts are made in japan right
parts are made in different places right i wonder who makes the the geos becau-
i think that's chevrolet
is it because they're so cute the geo storm is adorable
um-hum
that is really nice that's true i don't know anything about them at all do you know anyone who has one
no no i don't in fact i i sat in one a long time ago and slammed the car door and it felt a little tinny you know it wa- it's a smaller lighter car
i know
yeah
um-hum
but you know that was years ago that was about four years ago when i bought mine so it may have changed i know on looks i think the storm is just adorable little car for a single person
hm
yeah that is really cute that's true
hm are are you working yet
so
um well i'm in r._o._t._c. so i'll be in the army so on active duty so yeah
uh-huh
yeah because i was wondering if you're are you going to finance it
probably yeah is that a good way to go i guess i don't know which one
right
uh well i have been fortunate enough to be able to just pay for it and i i like to do that but there are people who can pay for it who prefer to finance it
uh-huh
really
yeah i- it seems to me as you're paying interest you're bound to be end up paying more i guess now you have to think about uh if the money in the bank will get more interest
right right
uh then then you'll want to finance it but if now the banks are giving so little interest i imagine you might as well just pay for it if you could
oh i see
[noise] okay um let me see [laughter] i've been sitting here awhile i almost forgot the topic but uh it seems like i get most of my news from television
[noise]
i'm we only get the paper on the weekends and so i'm not much of a
of a paper reader or
but i i and i'm don't rarely listen to the um radio so it i get most of my news like from documentaries like forty eight hours twenty twenty you know i- the news at night
um-hum
new- news in the afternoon and that kind of thing
uh-huh well i- i get a weekend paper as well and uh in addition to that i get a local weekly i- i live in suburb of milwaukee and they get they
[noise] uh-huh
have community newspapers around here so the local their extremely local [laughter] stuff uh is in the local paper that comes out once a week and then i get the sunday
uh-huh
uh milwaukee journal because i don't have time to read a paper uh mostly that's my difficulty i uh i get my news pretty much from the same source as you do although i do listen to n._p._r.
right
which has very good and that's national public radio which has very good uh coverage of the national and international news i feel and does a pretty good job of analysis as well usually
huh
um
are you in the car quite a bit or
no i'm not actually uh but i can run my radio in my office i- i i teach at the university and when i'm not
oh
oh
teaching if i choose to have the radio on i can listen to that station so
uh-huh oh i see um
ho- how are you are you satisfied with the twenty twenty and forty eight hours and the things that you do watch
yeah i i i pretty much am and i watch the news at least twice a day
uh-huh
so uh if i've missed something and an- and i've just recently decided to home with my children and so it seems as if i catch the news rise right as it ha- happens you know there was
um-hum
uh the explosions and that kind of thing my husband will say how'd you know about that and i said yes it happened at such and such time and that's so that that's different for me so i usually find out wh- exactly when it happens and that kind of thing
is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is is the timely you no- noting of the events as they happen is that what you feel good about in the news coverage
uh no it just seems like since i've recently stayed home
th- that is what's happened you know it's just that uh
i now that i've stayed home i'm i'm usually aware of wh- when these things have occurred and it happened and
uh-huh
well i- i myself uh the the reason why i listen to n._p._r. and the reason why i watch macneil lehrer rather than the
than the network sh- news shows at night although i do o- watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which sh- sh- you know carries over a lot of the national news stories uh is that
right right
quite often it seems to me that [noise] the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis
the local doesn't either but i feel that macneil lehrer get a little more deeply into some some of the issues that are really current
uh-huh
and perhaps newspapers do that but as i said i don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper and frankly when i have read a newspaper i haven't noticed that kind of analysis either
um-hum
hum
so um
there's there is some danger to that of course too because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then
you know how good is it but
uh i like a little more indepth coverage and i think that's what you're maybe appealing to you too on something like twenty twenty or forty eight hours
right right it kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story that kind of thing
um-hum
yeah
so
um
i'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world rather than simply being aware that
yeah
you know there that an event has occurred
[laughter] yeah
i i like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture maybe because i'm easily confused by detail i don't know
uh-huh yeah i know what you're saying
[laughter]
so
yeah but i try and catch most of those programs [noise] on wednesdays and fridays and if i miss them i try and
you know i try and and uh tape them if i'm out or that kind of thing i try and tape them and
so i can sit back and watch it and it's pretty interesting um
when you have young children right
um-hum
so those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the t._v. set for awhile without interruption
y- well yeah plus i find i have to video tape quite a bit of things if i don't want any interruptions yeah that kind of thing
oh you do uh-huh
uh-huh when is your good watching time
um it seems like ten o'clock at night [laughter]
uh-huh yes
yeah that's what wh-
unfortunately but that's that's what it seems like ten o'clock at night
i have older children and getting dinner on the table i come from the east coast and i was
uh-huh
[laughter] it amazed me when i got out here to the midwest and found out that even though they're an hour earlier in time they still watch the news when new y-
[noise]
okay go ahead
well uh a friend of mine actually works for mcdonald douglas in the uh in the space station program so i get to find out a lot of information about what's going on there and it sure sounds like
oh
sure
that's going to be a really viable program if it continues to be funded at current levels
uh-huh
um they're they're going to be doing a lot of interesting things um i think one of the the big things that he's involved with is the micro gravity payloads
and
that has a direct impact on a lot of things that we really can't do down here on earth including um some new pharmaceutical techniques
oh you're kidding yeah
so you know there's there's a a big opportunity for us to explore uh what sorts of things you can do in a zero gravity environment
hm
um-hum sure
so i suspect that we'll see a lot of gains from that
well that's good
because sometimes i wonder you know being a uh lay person out there of not uh knowing ex- exactly what's going on in space
whether you know they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not we're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here being you know
to me th- all this uh space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth
that uh we can't live on mars we can't live here we can't live there i mean this is the the place that we have to live i mean there's uh no other resource for us to to look at other than here so it's kind of like
to me i would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment that we have here
and not so much emphasis put on what's going out in space and what i- you know not that i want everything to halt and
let's forget about the space program or whatever because we're always curious and we always need to know more things but um
it to me it's kind of like let's try and clean up the air that we have here let's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here
mainly because uh the space program has taught us that there is no other place for [noise] us i mean this is it i mean if we would've
uh if we would have went into space and found mars a livable pl- uh planet we probably would have inhabited it and uh
you know who would have cared about earth it would have been another planet to kind of take over and uh continue on so you know and that
when i look at the space program itself i think of it you know as being in terms of it's it's interesting to learn but it's also
it's it brings down the fact that this earth is it it's it for us you know what i mean
right
um unless technology makes the decision that we all are going to live in space or whatever but
i would love to um go into the space shuttle some day and uh just see um
you know the earth and the different planets and things like that i i think it would be very interesting to do but whether it'd be feasible to do i don't know
well um
and as far as the practical aspects go i suspect that the space station may actually be a good compromise between you know deep splace i'm sorry deep space exploration and uh and not doing anything because
um-hum
um-hum
sure
we have the opportunity to off load some things to the space station
exactly um-hum
and uh you know perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things that uh we'd normally do down here that are damaging to the environment
um-hum
exactly yeah that's true
you know and uh i think of uh i i'm sure you probably have heard of the genesis program that's going on currently out in the arizona desert uh
uh-huh
there's uh you know they're trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create
you know an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the desert part of it and then they have an area that's more um you know full of uh vegetation tropicals that kind of thing to kind of uh
look at things and say you know the environment wise this is where we're living but what what effects it and how can we improve it and things like that and i i think in space um
i don't know how many people could live up in space uh for any length of time i mean i
just the way that we're affected by when it's cloudy out and it's cloudy for days and we don't see the sun
and the people their moods are extreme you know it's like god if i don't get to see the sun i'm gonna be in this bad mood all this entire time i mean this is how i see people reacting you know when is the sun gonna come out
right
so i wonder how you know somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the sun
you know in the aspect that we see it uh and never seeing uh you know light bright days you know and uh brea-
right
i think that the middle east is of all the uh regions of the world the most volatile that we seem to be getting ourselves involved in
[noise]
and uh
i'm not sure we're doing so with
sufficient knowledge about the history of the area and um with what uh the people there expect i think we're just getting ourselves into a barrel of trouble [laughter]
yeah well i think we may have the know- knowledge of the history but certainly not any understanding of the history
[noise]
uh
[vocalized-noise]
we seem to be you know doing the same we've done in many other cases which is sticking our noses in where it doesn't belong
[vocalized-noise]
and i think it's you know motivated
[vocalized-noise]
you know clearly by the fact of the resources that are controlled by the region which is
oh clearly yes and um
of the you know used up in the next twenty to fifty years there won't any o- any oil left i'm sure
hum
[noise]
well i feel that as far as u._s. policy's been concerned while i understand um a position in allied um friendship with israel
i think that we've applied a lot of double standards in the legion uh in the past as far as dealing with the arabs versus dealing with the israelis and the expectations that we put on the
um
uh arab nations uh while basically succumbing to a very powerful israeli lobby in this country
yeah
and i- i think that the palestinian question is a key to a lot of problems in the region
and i don't think that this country's handled that well at all
yeah well [vocalized-noise] probably from there is that the
same problem as anywhere else anytime you take something away from somebody and give it to somebody else
um-hum
that you [vocalized-noise] didn't own in the first place there's you know going to be problems i mean that's basically what's happened i mean
yeah
basically a handful of nations took away from palestinians what was their homeland and gave it to the isra- you know to the israelis
[noise]
and you know it's not the way to go about any kind of uh
solution that's ever going to be workable you know i mean y- neither party was consulted up front
yeah [vocalized-noise]
[vocalized-noise]
yeah i kind of anticipate that because you know we set the stage and how we've dealt with that issue in such a poor manner by basically you know
paying lip service to the palestinians in the past
hum
uh i think that's up the stage for the end effect to for this uh uh revolution of islamic fundamentalism what seems to be sweeping
definitely through north africa and uh within parts of the middle east as well something which terrifies the moderate arab states [laughter]
yeah
uh
well it's pretty scary anybody if you think about i mean an- any time you get fundamentalists you know whatever nature
yep
and in power anywhere i mean th- they're pure fanatics and there's that you know fundamentally no way to deal with a fanatic
[noise]
and you can't argue with them on any sort of logical or emotional basis
yeah i- i sus-
a fanatic will believe in x. y. z. and you're never going to change that
yeah
you know so you might as well not even try
i suspect that we'll probably in uh with the demise of the soviet union formation of russia whatever ends up coming out of that
um-hum
that probably the biggest problems we're going to have in foreign policy are going to have middle east in the future
i think that we're going to continue to see a lot more fundamentalist influence in the area it's been spawning for a long time
the more moderate states uh even including saudi arabia which is a very religious country islamic wise it's not allowed the fundamentalist to gain control
but uh i you know tunisia and uh now we have problems with sudan
um-hum
and uh these places i think that you know we're just in the beginning here of uh what will probably sweep through i mean egypt's suffering the same kinds of problems with fundamentalism right now
yeah
the more nations that join with this kind of uh thinking in government the more stronger uh difficulty we're going to have
as a nation in dealing with the region because of our past experiences with the palestinians
yeah i think a lot of it is is just rejection of the current
you know power structure and that power structure happens to be religiously aligned and aligned with uh you know a religious based monarchy in a lot of those countries
[vocalized-noise]
and that they're basically rejecting that power structure in favor of another which is you know return to a fundamentalist thing i mean it's not to unlike what happened in the united states
[noise]
over the last ten years i mean basically people rejected you know there's [vocalized-noise] fundamentalist you know movement
[laughter]
yeah
wasn't quite as severe or as you know fanatically radical i mean because the
uh
the class structure is is you know less
prolific here or less you know regionally defined here and uh
the uh the differences aren't so so strong as in say talking about like saudi we're you've got you know uh basically a ruling
[vocalized-noise]
have you had to return anything lately
[noise]
uh
i had a uh i have a boat i live on the water and i- i have a boat that i like to take out pretty much every day and
i uh took it into the shop to be repaired and i brought it back and it didn't run
and i got to i had to i took it back and told them what was wrong and
uh
uh took it back out and it still didn't run three times
i had to take it back
did you think it was uh the mechanic's problem or uh well with the bolt
uh was a mechanic mechanic's problem he didn't really know what was wrong with it and
you thought he had fixed it but he he not didn't
eventually it got to the point where i said i don't think you know what you're doing i'm going to take it somewhere else and
so i did and someone else finally fixed it
um did you have to pay this fellow
uh no i didn't pay him [laughter]
[laughter] i wouldn't image you'd want to
[vocalized-noise]
i paid him original money to do some other work that he did right but uh the rest of it i didn't
um
didn't pay him
no i was doing some thinking about products and have they really changed
and uh
i- i think it's hard to say cross the board that you're not getting what you're getting what you pay for anymore
i um just recently had an experience with uh sears uh do you have that down in florida
yeah
well sears is kind of famous for taking back almost anything they're very good about it
i had bought a leather jacket almost about twelve years ago for my ex-husband
he is still wearing the darn thing and you know after some time i was fortunate enough to get remarried to a really nice fellow and i happen to like this leather [vocalized-noise] jackets and i bought him one and his lasted about a year and a half and i said that you know there's no
uh this makes no sense the good guy didn't get the good jacket
and i called them up and i said i would expect a winter coat you know we do have in winters in new york and y- i guess you use it four months out of the year
um this guy didn't get eight months out of a winter coat all the stitches were coming out it's a real mess
you know i really expect you to do something about this and i hadn't really hang on to receipts or anything and it it took much song and dance
uh to get it done but i just picked up a brand new leather jacket today
oh good
so i- i'm pretty pleased about that the thing is it only cost about a hundred dollars which for a leather jacket is quite reasonable
but the repair i was going to just bring it in and have it repair the repair would've been about seventy
and i was darned if i was going to do it and i hated to throw it out
so i- i think if you make enough noise you can get your problems taken care of in most cases
[vocalized-noise]
yeah so they took it back and just exchan-
uh yeah i- i had to bring it in i had to talk to people in roanoke virginia i guess that's sears central [laughter]
but they were really good about it you know they i- i wasn't nasty i didn't attack them i said i'm so used to your stuff being wonderful i'm so shocked [laughter] and alarmed that this should happen
yeah
and i think it's how you conduct yourself as well if if you're kind of mean and nasty you get treated mean and nasty
yeah
but um i was very please and and it is true i uh you know generally they back up what they have and
it worked out nicely fortunately and it's you know it's like you know when someone else hits your car it's not your fault and you don't pay for it but you're majorly inconvenienced
yeah
and i had to carry this jacket around to repair shops and make dozens of phone [vocalized-noise] phone calls to get it fixed you know it's not like it didn't cost me anything in time and effort
yeah
but um
yeah [vocalized-noise]
[vocalized-noise]
what aggravating is uh how much how much time and effort you expect things to be
[vocalized-noise]
to be right the first time
right well you you were talking about boats it made me think about cars i had a ford station wagon that one day just died
and i called up the repair shop apparently this some kind of uh box in the uh ford car that just dies and they know it dies
and in every car you're going to have that's a ford car it's going to die and i guess after so many miles
and he told me over the phone before he even saw my car that's probably what it was
yeah
and it is and and they build this these little time bombs in so [laughter] you know so you got to bring it back
[vocalized-noise]
a little black box that
huh
tells you when to bring it back in to to for repairs
well [laughter] it was some kind of part where you can't even an electrical spark off the engine anymore it just the whole thing just dies when you this thing goes
yeah
and you really don't know when it's going to happen you just know that you're going to be stranded if you get another ford
and
that's not too
not too nice [laughter]
it's kind of upsetting
yeah
a- at the time i knew what it did and what it was called but i don't remember that now
yeah
have you found that uh clothes and shoes and things you bought [vocalized-noise] shoddy than they have in the past
uh well i haven't bought too much [laughter]
lately uh not for clothing
um
but uh i bought a a lot of stuff i remodeled the house and i bought a lot of a lot of new uh n- new kitchen and new uh fixtures and everything
and uh one thing that we i did buy that i had the only problem was a sears uh stove
um
and uh when i got it it'd a big dent on the top of it
so i had to
[noise]
[noise]
okay i'm here how do you feel about the public schools
well
our public schools are are really poor i feel um
uh-huh
i'm not sure where georgia ranks in the nation but uh we're toward the bottom
yeah
and uh there's a lot of things that i see
that are so obviously wrong
um-hum
that you would think it'd be easy to correct but the system doesn't allow for the corrections
right
um-hum
yeah how about you
well that's interesting i have a sister who used to live in kennesaw georgia
oh yes
and uh she has a young boy actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there
and she complained quite a bit about this school system there
yes
and
and cobb county is better than the county i'm in she was in cobb county
right
right i'm i can't really say much about the schools up here i really don't come from here [laughter]
uh-huh
i'm only up here temporarily on an internship but um i live in orlando florida usually
okay
and the schools down there from what i know are not bad they're pretty good
well that's great
but i know that in some i know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good
um-hum
for example i have a brother in north carolina and he says the schools there are are incredibly bad um just terrible
well i feel that we're way behind uh i have a son that is in the fourth grade and uh they have just now taken up division
hm
wow
uh yeah and and you know i [vocalized-noise] my husband and i go to the store and we buy these math books and and fractions and multiplication division things and
that is slow
i feel like uh
there are several areas that we're just really really slow in and uh
um-hum
i don't blame the teachers as much as i blame the system it is
what do you think's wrong to cause that
well well for one thing there's not enough money in the school system and the money they do have they're not they do not use it wisely uh she my son's teacher has twenty seven students
yeah
um-hum
and that's certainly is a lot of students for one person
yeah
to deal with on an every day basis
perhaps
uh
but more than that i don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children
yeah
and when you have two kids in that class that constantly keep the ca class in an uproar and you're not at liberty
yeah
to do something about it other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office and i-
yeah that's that's one thing i worry about
it you know it can you it can really be bad uh also i think
we have a lot of uh
hispanics
there you go uh-huh
and we have a lot of uh uh the county i am i'm in uh the minorities are mostly hispanic
yeah probably quite a few black people up there and and [laughter]
no [laughter] we're from a county and uh we're from the county they marched in we're in forsyth county yes and we and there's very very few blacks uh so uh so that's um
no
oh is that right
oh okay
i i hate to say [vocalized-noise] it's not a problem uh because i hate to feel like they are a problem although they are
yeah but you know it it it's you don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever but then again yeah there is no denying that i- that
but it is a problem
uh especially in the inner schools inner city
sure you know teachers you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school
well and [vocalized-noise] you can't put all the children in special education uh and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done
that's right you can't do that
right
you know
see i grew up in nebraska
um-hum
and the school that i went to there was fantastic it i i really consider myself very very lucky
um we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking twenty seven thirty kids to c- to a class
yeah
but your teacher had control
but
yeah we zipped right along you know i i was i was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily um
um-hum
yeah i i believe i was too
um-hum but you're right you know with all this [vocalized-noise] don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights you've also taken something away from the discipline i think
uh-huh [laughter]
um well it it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school we just cannot afford it
yeah
right i was gonna ask you if there that was an option
um if
[noise] okay um [noise] let me see unfortunately we are not much recycling [laughter] we don't we don't do enough i know we don't so
[noise]
uh-huh
uh although uh lately i've been uh a friend of mine that i spend a lot of time with
does recycle quite a bit and it's it it's uh interesting to watch some of the things that she does and then she's almost had an impact on me um
where [noise] she doesn't say anything to me when she comes to my house but i- i can kind of tell it bothers her so uh just unconsciously i've i've stopped buying a lot of um
[laughter]
um paper plates and paper cups and i don't do that anymore i don't know why i just don't i just from just from socializing with her so
how do you uh how uh is recycling done in your community is
it really it there's not a whole lot there really isn't uh i know in my mother's neighborhood in san antonio each
uh-huh
each house ha- they're they're given three baskets and they put them out on a certain day of the week
uh-huh
right
and each uh home does participate but we really don't have anything uh close in this area that that do anything and and some of the communities that do
the residents are having to pay to participate in it which really doesn't make sense
oh
right over here they um have several private companies that you can take uh recycled materials to
but um if you want to take them all to one place they have uh the first saturday of every month they have certain places that you can drop them off that's what i do um
and i i recycle aluminum glass
um
newspapers
yeah that's good
so it's nice to have you know one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place and
yeah yeah that's another thing you have to go to different places to do that
right
right so it's so that's nice it would be it would be really nice if they uh came to the house to pick it up and they just were talking about a bill in tucson about that but uh
uh it didn't go through
uh-huh but i heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that which uh i don't know it just doesn't make sense to me
so
right i guess what they what they were talking about here was um
was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something you know um
yeah
yeah
so i guess that's one option
yeah
that's good that's good
i guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too like um
um-hum
have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods they have this little number now that tells what kind of plastic it is
yeah
no
yeah i guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler
oh i didn't know that
yeah so now they're like marking um they're i don't know there's six seven eight different kind of plastics and they they mark on the bottom what kind it is
yeah
so i guess that makes it easy to recycle and then they're
they're um trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them you know that are that are only made out of one kind of plastic so that that makes it easier i guess
um-hum
well that's good i- i you know unfortunately garland doesn't have doesn't they don't i don't know they don't do anything like that or i i you know i read those little slips that come in wi- your utility bills
right
or your uh garbage collection and they haven't you know talked about doing something like that
where does your friend go to recycle
she lives in garland and i'm not sure where what she does but she's uh oh she's ve- very heavy in that and she takes her own bags to the grocery store
uh-huh
um she has n- i r- i really don't think she has any paper products in her house um
yeah
and just a lot of things i've learned off of her that to start doing and she does make a lot of sense just her whole house is like wow
yeah
i guess that's how it gets passed on you know when one person you hear it from another person and then uh
yeah
and then you and then you pass it on so it seems to be catching on uh
yeah
slowly but surely i guess [laughter]
yeah and uh my little boy ha- watches a program that was really neat i sat and watched him you know the barney
you know the little um i don't know if you know the little character barney they had one uh on that kind of type of thing and how children can
uh-huh
can do that and how to save water b- you know when you brush your teeth turn the water off and it's really caught on and he's only four and he's really caught on [laughter]
wow that's neat that's neat yeah when you
and keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing he has really caught on so that's really neat
[laughter]
well when you start early i gue-
you wanna go first
[noise]
no you can start [laughter]
okay um one of the things they talked about was uh
did we di- wha- do what do we think about a judge making the decision and i really don't agree with that
um-hum
i think that the trial by jury is better
uh you know than e- having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible
i don't think that they could be objective in every case every time
right
y- you know what i mean
right there's there th- thi- this topic is kind of moot um there there's no way we we couldn't survive in a sy- in a in a juror syst- in a trial system without a jury um
yeah
right
one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case
that's it
um every person has their opinions and that's why jury selection is often very difficult
um
well i- i feel the other thing too uh they were saying uh you know what new ways could you could it you you know change the system
i- i really think that um we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal i mean i- if you go to a trial by jury
[noise]
and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught you know point blank in the crime there's uh no question it's beyond a reasonable doubt
right
you all these things i mean you know we've gone through this uh over and over again
right they shouldn't allow an appeal
and it can go on for ten twenty years i- i think this is a little ridiculous
yep
um-hum
i think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers
no that's right i work for a law firm i ought i
i i'm serious and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems tha- ha- that exist in the in the criminal system today with plea bargaining
right
you know if someone is [vocalized-noise]
well plea bar- plea bargaining is a different story
well
plea bargaining is something completely different that that actually prevents trials or or at least speeds them up
well i know tha- that's what i'm saying but i think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up
in in that regard i mean you know people who commit uh crimes that they i don't know how it works exactly but you know they get lesser sentences and i understand that the jails are full of people you know uh
right
right
and that they have to do something but i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it
hum
you you know what i'm saying tha- we we don't have um well a lot of states don't have capital punishment
right
and um
we do [laughter]
i- i think they should i and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever like drunk drivers that kill people and um
you know all they they're caught dead to rights i- i just think that that's they've they've taken a life and if they should pay for it with their life
right
right
when you're saying as as far as the appeal um procedure is concerned we just have the case i'm i'm sure you've probably heard of marion berry
yeah
uh-huh
um his fi- his last appeal was was denied two days before his sentence was up [laughter]
oh really
so i mean his appeal was denied and two days later he got out of jail [laughter]
it uh [laughter]
for cocaine possession but um
yeah
that was absurd [laughter] there was no there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence
i know that the [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
an- i don't know uh wha- what would you do to change it to make it better
well
uh
the the only thing i can i was you know the the appeal procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of um i like i said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd there's no way that could work
oh yeah i- i i don't agree with that at all
um
but
imagine the guilt that person would have i mean it burned out is there's no possible way that you could um you know feel good about yourself if you had to do something like that day after day
oh exactly exactly
right
no one would want the job [laughter]
no rea- not really
um
[noise]
and
you know like i said the you know everyone has their opinions about every case
well wou- do you think people should have a trial if they're caught dead to rights like
oh yeah i i feel that everyone is everyone is um entitled to a trial by jury that that that right sh-
i mean supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you
well i mean were there witnesses
in other words you're saying that we you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were
right
right that you can't you can't remove the jury regardless of the case i mean you could have fifty people in audience watching [laughter] a murder take place and you you'd still there's still mitigating circumstances
yeah
yeah
well it's i- i feel
[noise] see wh- whe- when you're with a big company or a big organization a lot of times uh you know the benefits are good and and you know the pay's regular
[noise]
but uh we- you know sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on and i- i- i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that that uh that uh anybody could get in uh in dealing in a with a large company
is to be in a situation where you you get to know what's going on and maybe that's that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do
what's what's your feeling about benefits what sort of benefits would you like to get from a big compa-
well since i'm kind of on the the older side you know i- i- i just feel like uh when i start talking about benefits i talk about i'm concerned about medical benefits [noise]
um
my um my husband works for mcdonald douglas and so m- his benefits his medical benefits are so excellent you know that's really great
um-hum
you know i work for um wes- a bank western financial
um-hum
and uh they don't let me know really about anything that's going on
even some of the immediate things that i need to know i don't know it until the next hour and then all of a sudden we know we've gotten changes made we're changing departments we're changing policies we're changing doing other kinds of things which to me is is disturbing
i mean i feel like if i- i don't necessarily need to uh be involved since i'm pretty much on a low level you are you are right there you know i'm pretty much on a low level as far as uh
uh the company is concerned but i i do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening and i think i can be a better and more effective employee if if i had a little bit more information along that line
well th- i
i well i- i work for the government and uh actually i work for the f._b._i.
oh my gosh
and uh and so well you know we we don't there's lots of things that we don't get told for good reason
but uh but basically uh there's lots of things that that we should know about projects i'm an engineer
um-hum
you know i'm i'm a c._o._t._r. and sometime- and i worked in the same lab with a guy and we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years and we should've you know we're we're now collaborating
oh
[laughter] and it did- for two years we didn't and wh- which was uh kind of stupid
and it it
but uh but uh our organization is doing something else t- on monday uh we're having a for all unclassified programs we're we're having little tables put out in front of you know lab in the hallways
and everyb- all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do
which i thought was kind of interesting
and bu-
yeah that is interesting
but uh but that sort sort of thing but but i- but ju- i think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on
exactly
and and but of course most time most the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know
and you know if you don't really count if you're not part of the program you might not get told for months or you might you know if it doesn't impact you directly or if your management doesn't think that
but but regard to benefits you know most companies have most big organizations have decent you know benefits like retirement and that sort of thing
in the private sector i would think that one of the major uh situations especially when you reach you know the the mid fifties wa- is
keeping a job until you retire
hm ah right
uh and engineers are uh [noise] are baggage to most uh uh as they get older to to most companies
and uh it's very much like the military it windows out you know you you think well boy i'm getting more money and i'm getting more responsibility i'm doing this but as you climb up that tree pretty soon you're the the the branches get smaller on the top of the tree
um-hum
and pretty soon somebody falls off i- i've fallen off twice in my private sector
oh
and uh [laughter] an- and you know i can get up
i know it it seem to be kind of kind of scary you know because you think of um
see my son's eighteen right now and he he's uh he wants to go into engineering
and the the the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now is kind of open and he's interested in basically three different areas but
uh it's difficult for me to [noise] to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that he needs to do his own course investigation and and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years
um-hum yeah
and in thirty years it becomes pretty critical i mean my um brother-in-law is like um i mean he's sixty he's not ready to retire but his company is is c- is um is uh closing up
um-hum
and because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff and all the nuclear and stuff which is what he what he was working on he's getting cut back and he's not ready to reti-
yeah he may be retired
uh i don't know do you want to start
[noise]
well i haven't uh i haven't thought a lot about g- government universal health care i've uh uh
worked for a you know private company that that provides uh health insurance although i you know th- they're
like many are are increasingly working on uh cost cutting things such that at this point i'm not very satisfied with the kind of things that they're doing they [noise] gone to
um-hum
network doctors which doesn't include our uh doctors and uh only certain hospitals well
hm
network hospitals where they will
uh [noise] same deal as the doctors that they will pay a higher percentage and pay more of the costs with if you use their particular ones that they've negotiated with but uh
um-hum
uh i don't like the uh seems to me that we're gett- that that's kind of going towards the the
[noise] socialized medicine in terms of of
not having a choice in where where or when you want to have have your
health care uh without the government being involved it's just a private form of it but the same kinds of of drawbacks i think uh uh what about you what what's your situation as far as
um-hum
yeah
well um i'm a graduate student and so i get health care through the school um so i'm for health care purposes i'm a a state employee so we have the state employees union
okay
um-hum
um and we have our choice of like twenty different plans with you know twenty different companies that operate in the state um and you know i'm on blue cross blue shield uh i guess it's uh comprehensive
um and you know i end up i'm paying [laughter] like five dollars a month for health care coverage you know um and then i pay another five dollars for dental um
hm um-hum
so you know for someone who's in a huge union like uh the you know all state employees it it you know
yeah
yeah
kind of the issue is kind of moot but i look at my parents my father's um self employed he's an attorney um and right now i mean it's just him and two secretaries and he pays out uh
yeah
what is it forty eight hundred dollars a month for health care for the family and and the two uh secretaries you know which is yeah it's just [vocalized-noise] it's extraordinary you know um
amazing
yeah
[noise] yeah
and so you know i look at my end of it and things aren't too bad but you know i look at at my father's side of things and they're horrible you know and i hear a lot of horror stories from other people too
yeah
um you know that they have to deal with horrible um you know p._p._o.s or h._m._o.s or something like that you know where you can't choose your own doctor and and you
um-hum
um-hum [noise] and and uh you know i- it uh uh
company i work for is bi- big enough that they can that that they've got clout but i you know feel guilty and resent a little bit the fact that that [noise]
for instance y- people like your father that just leaves them worse off cause the the health care providers end up making up w- what uh my employer doesn't pay them uh by charging more for uh
um-hum
other people you know so that that that doesn't seem to me to be a fair thing either and uh from
exactly yeah
no
from what i hear canada has a -as a really a a pretty good system in terms of of universal government health
uh insurance depending on who you listen to why there may or may not be longer waits than here for some elective surgeries but but uh
um-hum
in terms of the per person health care that they spend it's it's on the order of half as much uh
as the as the per capita average in the united states i think and and very nearly comparable service and i you know [vocalized-noise] i'm i'm willing to accept some [vocalized-noise] some limits in terms of [noise]
[noise] i think it's oregon that just gone through a uh passed a state uh health insurance scheme where they had a commission draw up a very uh
um-hum
you know very detailed and stringent priority list of what uh of of the uh different procedures and the and their costs
um-hum
and prioritized in terms of the of the cost effectiveness and then just went down the list and said okay here's the cutoff point uh if if you're below this point then it the the odds of it doing you
any good versus the costs are just not enough to be um effective and we'll uh we won't pay for those things and uh you know i'm i'm not
hm interesting
the biggest social change that i've seen in the last ten years
[noise]
is that i you know i'm only twenty four twenty five right just turned twenty five and ten years ago i can remember when it was not common to see two people in a family or household working
and getting behind and uh running into economic problems the way things are today um
you know today just to get by in many cases you have to have two people working in the middle income house just to stay with where they were in the seventies
um-hum
um-hum um-hum i agree with that
and and it's it's really rough that's probably the biggest thing i've noticed
well i'd have to take a slightly different thing uh viewpoint uh i'm uh thirty five uh and um
uh uh to me it's something a little more subtle it it's just a prevalence of computer technology and uh everyday life i mean
i can remember when everything was still done by by han- by paper by hand [laughter] as opposed to computer generated paper now [laughter]
yeah
[noise]
um you know uh befo- you know when uh clerks in grocery stores uh actually had to be able to add things up and in their head and check it
[laughter]
[laughter] which is [vocalized-noise] plusses and minuses there i guess [vocalized-noise]
yeah
i remember when we were going to the grocery store when i was younger those big monstrosity cash register
oh yeah yeah [vocalized-noise]
with the greens buttons the rows and rows [laughter]
yeah um-hum
and it was actually quite and art form to see some of the you know older or or more experienced cashiers go you know fly through that is like those japanese hippies see what the abacus is still
yeah
uh so uh maybe that's just a different viewpoint uh but uh i just
remember everything well just writing a letter fo- for work you know i mean in word processor you know we can [vocalized-noise]
to me i can't even image now how they even produced books or letters before word processors you know then we'd have to through fifty iterations at least the way i write letters and things
[vocalized-noise]
[vocalized-noise]
yeah i- i found all through school you know you write your hand to death you go through pens and uh i'm actually because i have two computers here
i'm actually loosing the ability to write by hand and feel comfortable doing it
[laughter]
[laughter]
it's too slow i think the speed of the co- i think much faster because i can type much faster than i can actually write now
yeah
and i what happens is words will drop out of writing and i'll go back because i'm thinking so i'm thinking at the speed that i type on the computer
right right
and you know we didn't have that problem ten years ago and then we didn't have fax machines and we didn't have to you know press one if you want to be directed to the service department press two [laughter]
right
yeah i you know i- i- i don't even write any more mainly because uh well i can type faster like you can and also my handwriting is [vocalized-noise] legible i can't i can't blame it on that printer most of the time so [laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
it's it's incredible you know i remember i started on a commodore sixty four in ninety eighty six that was my first computer
and today i'm on a three eight six thirty three and it's too slow you know i can't wait
yeah hey same here same here yeah w-
[laughter]
it's got to go faster you know
well we're getting greedy i guess but uh well with regarding to your comment i- i have to agree with that too there's a prevalence of uh
[vocalized-noise]
of uh two income households that uh you never really saw before although i probably on the exception of that my both my parents did work but most of my friends parents when i was growing up
hum
the mother did not and uh it's simply not the case and uh
t- to keep the uh bank that owns your house happy the bank that owns both your cars happy and the bank that owns your credit card happy [laughter] uh you do have to
[noise]
[vocalized-noise]
i think my wife in fact uh started to work part-time now because we'd started out we got married she had not uh uh wanted to work uh after we had our first kid and i said fine but now
paying for these kids [laughter] she's she's had to back to work part-time
oh yeah up here
up here in rochester almost everybody works for kodak or xerox and t- ten years ago you were always assured of having a job [laughter]
um yeah i remember that
[laughter] and now you you know i my grandfather worked for his entire life for kodak my father the same thing but now everyone's worried and
and uh you can't rely on that kind of thing anymore everything sped up so fast and there's no more old-fashioned reliability in things anymore the way pa- the pace has changed
i remember when i got out of college which was seventy eight people said now if you get a job with general motors or at&t or i._b._m.
you're set for life [laughter]
um-hum
not after at&t's going to let go fifty thousand people i i'm uh constantly putting stuff up in [vocalized-noise] telecom
from the c._w._a. the union there and they're letting people go like crazy it's just it they're replacing them with computers
well you plus you kn- you know after the uh divestiture or well break up
[noise] i guess i guess by what you said you're you you don't feel you're uh privacy has been inva- invaded anytime recently
[noise]
no not really um
uh th- um
th- the only thing that annoys me is when uh people call and they uh you have solicitation calls
um-hum
probably thing that bothers me that's not really invading my privacy um
right
do you feel that yours is invaded
uh nah i wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means uh you know i would there there's a lot of times though uh you get those calls and you know
[noise]
when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or or whatnot and you know next thing you know
uh someone calls and wants to sell you this or that and it's real hard to y- to tell them you know that you're not interested or you do tell them you're not interested and they still keep asking you you know and a-
keep badgering you about it and that aggravates me but i don't know that you could call that invading of m- invading my privacy because
[noise] you know if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look you know i want my name unlisted or i want my you know
but but that doesn't work
it doesn't
uh no because they a lot of times they dial sequentially they get your name from uh if you enter any type of contest or anything
um-hum
um you know you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something you put your phone number on there they pass your phone number on to another company
oh
um or you um
or or like the newspapers they just dial randomly or s- and stuff they even call the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe
[laughter]
and uh while i was subscribing to the paper i got so upset at them that they you call me one more time i'm going to stop subscribing
uh-huh
[laughter]
and the l- the local local papers will nice just you ask them to remove your uh number from their list and um
yeah you call up their regular du- during regular hours their um they have a special department they'll take your numbers out of their list
um-hum
uh but the uh
orlando paper um yeah th- they they refused to take you off of the list and they call every month
hm
and when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have
good grief
well let me ask you about this here's something that uh -s been kind of concerning me lately my fiance received a bill from a a lord and taylor company uh y- you know they're a they're a department store
um-hum
she received a bill from them uh that she had visited so- some store and and i think it was there in florida maybe it was in miami
uh that she had visited a store there and uh they had this bill uh that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise uh over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise
um-hum
uh and the date that that she supposedly made this purchase she was in denver with me for thanksgiving um and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number um
um-hum
um-hum
and and i've i've heard recently that uh
uh that this is a common occurrence where people are using s- you know they they use joe blow's so- uh social security number uh and can uh potentially ruin someone's credit
uh-huh if you know a person's social security number and their mailing address i- and their mother's maiden name [laughter] uh you can basically become that p- uh person
[laughter]
huh
um if the purchase was m- made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to and since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove you know that it wasn't her um
um-hum
if it was so- you know coming into the store and stuff then she would of ha- whoever made the purchase would have ha- sign some kind of um you know document and uh wh-
yeah
the signature um they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature and if they can't provide a signature uh you know they'll they have to eat the charge
yeah well y-
but if the pers- has had their social se- her social security number i'd be real concerned that they uh
that she's not uh blacklist on uh tel- what is it it's telecreder something um
yeah
because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there she probably won't be ab- able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle
yeah well we got it cleared up eventually what happened uh
[noise]
[noise]
well what's your opinion on capital punishment
well uh
i uh i agree with it as long as uh
as long as there's no
no shadow of a doubt of guilt
ri- i agree with that too i uh th- this is probably going to be not a big debate or anything [laughter] uh
uh
[laughter]
i am for capital cu punishment only for murder i mean you know i think they asked in the recording uh w- i- in what crimes but only
um-hum
if someone has murdered someone you know that's about the only thing but uh how is georgia for uh capital punishment are they executing people or
uh yeah yeah um
not very often but they they do send some
every now and then you know as
what
well needless to say texas is uh probably the leader
uh i we may have started you know capital punishment back up again and uh i think we've probably executed more people than any other state
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
but uh
a case out in california what was it a week or so ago was rather interesting in how that uh they prolonged the guy that was supposed to be executed
yeah
and i just i can't see any real value in just letting these people live out their sentences
um-hum
yeah it seems a little bit ridiculous because of
just the tax dollar it takes to
maintain somebody that's hopelessly [laughter]
[noise] you know just uh violent
um-hum and
and uh it's doesn't make much sense
how do you feel about insanity pleas
i uh
i i don't think it's much of a
a
reason for
um
i i don't think it's much of a
reason to get somebody off a off the hook i mean
like uh jeffrey dahlmer i i don't know i haven't
followed that since you know it was on the news but
uh you know i've i've heard that there might be some insanity there i don- you know i'm i'm not
at all up to date on that but you know if uh something like that if i- if you can
get off on sa- insanity on something like that which i i believe you know there's a certain degree of insanity there but that's certainly no-
um-hum
i don't i don't believe it's uh
an excuse by any means you know
well i had heard of a case out in california of someone who had murdered his parents or some sort of thing and they put him away uh
in an insane asylum you know because he pleaded insanity and after he was in maybe twelve years or so they let him out he went out and he killed five more people
yeah yeah i just don't
so
i don't think that's uh
an excuse at all
well i guess it's sounds rather heartless but i guess if they're that bad if they're that badly off mentally then perhaps it's just as well to to end their life
um-hum
yeah yeah
aren't we cruel people [laughter]
[laughter]
oh i don't i don't think so i mean i just you know
[laughter]
if i i think in japan you know when crime gets bad they you know they take a few criminals out in the public square and they execute them and crime goes down [laughter] you y- you know
[laughter]
uh so there's i think it i think it works since most people don't believe in being forced you know
well i s- they may say it's not a deterrent and perhaps it isn't but i guess
i just feel if nothing else it's justice i know that if someone murdered a member of my family i'd want justice done and i'd want to see them punished for their crime
yeah
yeah yeah i i agree
so
i agree
uh perhaps the people in the middle east have kind of a good idea you know if you steal something they cut off your hand and and the punishment fits the crime
yeah yeah
uh-huh
but uh [laughter]
yeah
yeah i think that's uh
[laughter]
not a bad idea of course there there'd be a lot of people [laughter] that couldn't uh couldn't function for awhile you know until they got it through their heads that you know that was going to be enforced [laughter]
well this is very true
[laughter]
[laughter] you'd have to phase that one in slowly or i think or you would have
[laughter]
use someone as an example and see how it worked
a bunch of
yeah
[laughter]
but then you got to pick who it's going to be
well i i was a little concerned i was going to get someone on the phone that was totally against capital punishment and
in any conversation that i've had through this t._i. thing you know i've never met anybody that i got into a screaming argument with or even really disagreed with heavily but i thought this could be one you know it could be a very [noise]
yeah
yeah
yeah
[noise] you wanna start or you want me to start
well go ahead if you're
okay [noise] personal interests in computers basically nowadays it seems like you can't get by without one everywhere i go it's got some kind of computer interface like pressing on keyboards
uh pressing in personal identification numbers all the a._t._m. machines things like that i personally don't own one because i can't afford one
uh every time you look in a friend's houses and they show you their computers and all the knickknacks they have it seems like they go from their basic computer to all these peripheral devices like uh modems and
fancy printers or lazy printers and fax machines and games that they like to play course i i was impressed by some of the games they have like flight simular game simulator for the different aircraft
yeah well that's uh [noise] actually you might guess you could say even more than just a game it's uh
similar to the one they use at uh for training
very close to it i understand
except for the bouncing around it
[noise] well i have a i just got a i used to use a t._i. p._c. at work now i just got a 386
uh computer p._c. [noise]
[noise] you using it mostly for spreadsheets or do you use it for like word processing
uh [noise] well i use it uh
in my business i have to uh tie into the mainframe and also into a uh minicomputer a 990
so i use a terminal emulation in uh talking to other computers plus word processing i do quite a bit of that
[noise] and it's uh that's suppo- one of the features of the
the new one the 386 it's got windows on it and so you can toggle back and forth between uh applications and you know get a
get a lot quicker in and out
used to be you had to log off [noise] then log back on the other application
yeah i use a z248 286 at work but it's basically to tie into the communications network
then through our communications network we go to our mainframe on the base there
um-hum
and use the unix operating systems
yeah
use their v._i. editor and we use um read on line news through it
and we also have terminal emulations through i._b._m. thirty two seventy eight
um-hum
and [noise] i don't know i just don't i don't even use the hard disk drive to to copy any floppy disks or anything like that i just basically use it for a
a window into there to the unix world
um-hum
yeah uh
we're supposed to be getting a fifteen hundred minicomputer pretty soon
uh is that i._b._m. or is that an i._b._m. type
replace our 990 huh
uh no it's a t._i. made 1500 it's a a minicomputer
uh it's a newer version of the nine ninety which is one they had
it uses uh unix as one of the operating systems
but uh
i'm familiar with unix commands like um copying files and compressing them things like that i just have a fun time using their mainframe at the base but
[laughter] well unix to me i mean uh that system five i mean that's pretty [noise] looks pretty uh user unfriendly [laughter]
[laughter] it's like a different language all right
uh
[noise] it seems like they sure uh
i got a lot of stuff to learn i haven't used it that much so
[noise] yeah we can use system five or we can use um c. shell
you know i like um i favor c. shell over the other
um-hum
i think i think most of our users like bourne shell because they were trained in it and they just don't wanna learn something different
[laughter]
that uh that's a powerful force [laughter] once you that's a powerful force once you learn something you you tend to wanna stick with it
pardon
oh yeah plus everybody in your office knows it and as the new people come in they kind of help each other out
but you have different people with different backgrounds and they have a hard time sharing information [noise]
that's like i learned uh d._f._m. and p._f._m. you know professional file manager which is can be used as a word processor it doesn't
it does everything i need moves splits you know all that but uh
doesn't have some of the little fancy stuff like underline caps bol- i mean bold and all that so
uh that's other than that it's you know perfectly suitable for most things i do
[noise] yeah the dis- disadvantage of v._i. editor you can't see all those fancy things [noise] i have another thing called q-office from quadratron back in california that people like to use but it's a very slow system
um-hum
and i understand it's only on like we use a gold 9050
and that's basically their format they use for word processing and they're trying to push people into using either wordp-
[noise] so what do you think
um well i think uh there's been significant change over the last couple of decades uh
i guess i would say that one of the most um important changes seems to be
um
that the family the definition of family is changing a lot
yeah
oh yeah no doubt about it the nuclear family and just the whole downsizing approach
right
you know a lot of people are are are not having kids
are not having kids as as early or as many
right
you know and that's yeah that goes hand in hand with some of the stuff that i had you know like maybe the whole emphasis on the environment and on so- kind of a social awareness approach
to where people are starting to think about pollution and trash a little more and uh and the ozone layer and things like that
right
yeah exactly
it's really putting some constraints on your whole uh the whole lifestyle which is
it seems to me it seems to me like um like everyone is lamenting you know the loss of the nuclear family and saying that it's going to be the downfall of america but to me um
um-hum
i don't know i guess that that's that's probably a pretty liberal view but i mean to me the the old um traditional nuclear family um
[laughter]
seems to only wo- seems to work real well uh you know when uh husband is in charge of the family when he's working when mom's home taking care of the kids
um-hum
yeah
and you know as soon as mom gets equal rights and she can work too
then all of the sudden you know there's all these constraints on the family i mean face it it's basically
yeah
an old um you know religious construction so um it's it's
sure
yeah
see to me it
no i- i actually i actually think um it's it's better the way it's working out i- i think
yeah i'm
i think that when each person is is working that uh it makes for mo- it makes for like two dependent people
yeah
and two independent people who are sharing their lives rather than one person dependent on another person seems to me uh
um-hum
it could be i'm i'm kind of a conservative uh myself although
i don't know i've got mixed views i come from a very very conservative family where there are you know it's like you me- you m- it's like you described the first time
uh-huh
um where the the husband's in control the wife stays home raises the family things like that however
uh-huh
i don't think that's a realistic approach anymore especially with the the rising cost of living and things like that there's there's almost no way you can make it with a one income family anymore
yeah it just seems that way
um
you know regardless of the of the social impact or the the familial impact you got to think about
just the pragmatic side of it in terms of how can you afford to raise however many kids one or nine
exactly
um with one income and it's never going to work i don't think um
see i came from um a pretty conservative family too
yeah
but the uh thing is that it didn't work out and my parent's split up so maybe that's what [laughter] yeah maybe that's what um influenced my view
oh really
yeah my parents yeah my parents fought like cat and dogs um they they did stay together finally and they've been married like forty years now but
right
right
i know i know what you mean because there's there's a lot of stress in that kind of an environment where the husband's gone all day
and comes home at night and like the wife is like the first thing she hits him with is all these problems
[laughter] you know so both sides are are under a lot of stress that way
right
right
i don't know i was
of course of course when both um parents are working the big question is you know who how how do the kids get raised
exactly you know that's something my sister's having to face right now they've both got they've got working parents both of them and it's like they're always shuffling them off to day care
right
and you've got to ask yourself whose morals and whose values are being you know enforced on my kid [laughter]
e- exactly um-hum
you know they come home and start swearing like a blue streak wait a minute i didn't teach them that stuff you know
one system that um is interesting that that w- we may take in
that we might be good might be good for us to take into consideration is um in israel they have this [vocalized-noise] you heard of that
no i haven't
[noise] where the kids are
it's kind of like of like uh a community school i guess where you know all the kids um
it's kind of like a boarding school i guess and they're but they're raised by adults who sort of act as
um-hum
their parents you know because i guess in israel
um you know that happens a lot too that the women are working and or in the army or something like that well um
right
[laughter]
um i don't know it seems
that's kind of interesting
seems to work really well and they somehow they um do it in such a way you know that they they pass on morals pretty well
[noise] okay uh [laughter]
[noise]
well we just got our income tax return and i'm perfectly happy what about you [laughter]
well let's see um i haven't gotten mine yet because my parents are getting all that stuff at um at home in the bay area
uh-huh
uh-huh
so i'm not sure how much i'm getting back but i'm pretty sure should get back a little bit since i'm still a student so not too much
yeah
yeah
not too bad though
but as far as writing checks out and paying taxes i think it's pretty high but i i'm uh you know i i guess that's where we have to be where it we have to keep raising them for to keep some of the things that that we have and
yeah it it's one of [noise] those necessities of life that we all have to you know pay taxes but uh although it is kind of a pain sometimes though
it's just scary though about you know how high are the taxes gonna be when my children are my age
um-hum
you know that that's that's scary too because it's not anything like the way it was when i was young and small and a child so
uh-huh
you know that that's a scary part too that you have to think about
yeah and and like as as time goes on you know things get more expensive and because we're [vocalized-noise] we're increasingly complex society that day by day things get more um things get more expensive as well as more complex
[noise]
um-hum
yeah
and you know taxes are one of the ways that help pay for a lot of the things that are needed in this society
yeah
i mean everything from you know from medicare to um to social security to um to feeding the ho- to um to you know feeding the homeless to uh maintaining prisons to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that
and it's now there's more and more things that need attending to and that sort of thing and
um-hum
you know it's it's becoming a a large responsibility but s- someone has to pay for it and that's us
yeah and then you find out about all these things about are your taxes you know the taxpayers are your m- is your money going to where you want it to go and there's gonna be a special this week i i can't i can't remember if it's twenty twenty or one of those things where um
i think it's one of the local news i think they're having an a documentary something about that about they're trying to catch some people about
not spending your tax p- monies right and fraud and that kind of thing you know and that's kind of scary too
um-hum
and uh so that would be interesting to see i wanted to see that program
yeah and and even even today it's like you know there's still a considerable amount of taxes that you know we're paying for but you'd think that we're still in thi- this this uh deficit state that we're still not able to pay off things just because
i know
the budget's not big enough as it is
yeah
and makes you wonder when there's [vocalized-noise] you know uh countries out there that have you know tax rates also like close to fifty percent or higher
um-hum
you know it's like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone before you can get it and that that's kind of a scary thought and i hope it doesn't come down to that
um-hum
yeah [laughter]
but on the other hand they also whi- while those countries that have high taxes also have things like um like socialized medicine and things like that too which are nice fringe benefits of it
so everyone has everyone has the access to medical facilities as well as the doctors that sort of thing and it's good but it's it's the price they pay [laughter]
um-hum
yeah
i mean it it can be argued one way or another whether the economically it's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because tho- those countries tend to be um as far as cash flow a a lot
um have a be tend to have a much slower cash flow and don't try and generate a larger um
um-hum
a large amount of revenue because there's so little um currency flow through out the economic system
hm
well
you sure do know a lo- know a lot [laughter]
uh just keeping up with the times that's all
yeah yeah
as i- as it turns out you know it's one of those one of those interests that you know i kind of like to keep up on because well it's nice to know that when i'm actually you know i do start working that
i'll like to know like where my tax dollars are going too [vocalized-noise] i work hard to to get you know i like to know where it's going to
um-hum
yeah
yeah
that's true
um-hum
what do you think about these items that are gonna be um taxed even more like um tobacco and that kind of thing
i think in a in a way it's good in a way it's not um but i think in general it's probably good i mean a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that have been have been in the past
um-hum
um have been not taxed because there's been such a large lobby against them against the taxes for them you know sponsored by alcohol and tobacco companies
um-hum
um-hum
and it's things like tobacco are um they're they're a proven health hazard to smokers as well as nonsmokers
yeah
right
and it's as far as a safety thing in like in san luis obispo for example there's an ordinance which states that um there's no smoking in any public areas
and so if you walk into any restaurant or any hotel there's no smoking allowed anywhere
oh really
um-hum
well my basic idea on dealing with the u._s. budget as unrealistic and [laughter] as it may be
[noise]
is to first of all put an end to these kinds of uh hidden user fees and uh
um other types of uh tricks that have been used
to help mask the size of this thing let's get a hold of what the real true sized of it is and then let's deal with it immediately and as quickly as possible even if it means some short term higher taxes
to get it down and uh then let's try to make some reforms with the the congressional community ha ha [laughter]
try and make it so that we don't have this problem in the future
well i have to i have to say that i would be very in favor
of
a situation where the revenue generation activities of the government such as the i._r._s.
are monitored and
spending for year
x. plus one
can go no higher than the revenues brought in during year x.
you know
so that uh forget about this balanced budget this would immediately force them
to say well geez um you know last year was a bad year and we've only got you know we only took in two hundred million dollars uh
i realize that i'm off by a factor of about five but [laughter] we only took in two hundred million even though this year is going better we can still only spend two hundred million
[laughter]
i- i just keep seeing unfortunately the p- a lot of the problem why we have this deficits balloon especially during the eighties is just because the american people
bought into this notion that well we can just uh we don't need a higher taxes certainly not they get enough of our money already and
the deficit doesn't seem to affect me in my daily life and routine so so what
it's going to affect your kids
yeah i know but you notice these people are only now starting to think ahead
[noise] [vocalized-noise]
well i- i think this has always been the case with the american public in that
it's made up of a bunch of special interest groups it's only recently that special interest groups have started to exert more power
um-hum
uh for instance retirees they've started to up social security benefits it used to be so social security was just the final safety net
yeah
but it's not that way anymore uh now you've got people who have
uh sixty thousand in tax free income because they invested wisely during their working years and they're still collecting social security and all of that money is tax free
um-hum
i'm sorry i think that um all of the investment income regardless of how you invested should be taxable
and the thing is that you should loose social security benefits based on how much income you have
yeah the only the only problem comes down as that a lot of people will scream and yell especially the a._a._r._p. because they were yelled that well we paid for this all along was this a hidden secret tax the whole time that's our money that they don't want to give back to us now [vocalized-noise]
uh yeah i- i- i- i agree i think that social security ought to be done away with and put into the uh [vocalized-noise] tax
um-hum
and that's what it is so go ahead and put it in there and uh
uh you know i mean they're treating it as a tax they're treating the money as tax revenue it's not something that they're putting aside for later use it goes into the general fund whether or not
it wants to to go there that's that's were it goes and it's being used so i mean um
uh my personal opinion out here in california we just instituted term limits on the uh senate and house for the state legislature
um-hum
and i don't know whether it's going to have
uh the affect that of course all the the career politicos here say oh my god you know you're going to have a bunch of amateurs running the state legislature
[noise]
well well so what [laughter] they can't do any worse than the guys that are in there now and [vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
well yeah we have that out here in new york too you know with governor mario king mario and
[laughter]
the legislatures are opposing parties are controlled by opposing parties which means basically every year we have a scream and terrified over the budget
yeah
in this state which is delayed eternally and then they want to kill each other you know [laughter]
well i think that what we may end up with with the term limits is you get more people involved in government
um-hum
you get more people seeing how it should work and i think what that will do is that will allow people to say well wait a minute
we've got to compromise we've got to work on something we need more of a vision and less of uh god i'll grab my money and do everything i can
[noise]
[noise]
are they doing a lot of recycling out in georgia
well um at my uh workplace they are we have uh places for aluminum cans and we have uh everybody's been issued a separate trash can for uh
recycl- recyclable paper le- let's see them get that word straight uh
uh-huh
as far as the community goes uh it's pretty much voluntary nothing's been done um i don't where i live i live in an unincorporated area
and we don't have any uh we have just private uh garbage services and uh
uh as far as i'm concerned i- i guess i should do it but being lazy i don't if if somebody made it easy for me to separate my trash and pick it up i would more than gladly participate [laughter] uh
yeah i i- it is it is to some degree inconvenient i'd have to say that
um
uh around here they've given us mine already got run over um i- it [vocalized-noise] looks sort of like a milk crate a little blue mil- milk crate and i have two kids
and it's not big enough it's it's kind of it's kind of silly and what you do is you put out paper like paper bags and newspaper and cardboard
[laughter]
and that you put separately and you also put out in this little ridiculous container any cans or bottles you have you know like your campbell soup cans and your milk cartons and that kind of stuff
hm
and then the rest you can ju- you throw out and the town picks it up
i've heard of communities where you have to separate your garbage and then put what's left in a clear plastic ga bag so they can kind of look and see if you're throwing out what you shouldn't i thought that was pretty amusing
have the garbage police looking after you i guess
i imagine i don't know
uh well i used to live in california and um just before i left they were um some communities were making that uh mandatory and uh um
[vocalized-noise] fortunately i was in a i was in an apartment complex and for some reason we just threw everything in the dumpster that was all right
well you know it's funny we just got back from a trip to california visiting some friends uh near san francisco and san jose and we'd see these signs on the road that said garbage pickup two exits down or something
the apar- for the apartment dwellers they didn't make it easy to recycle at all what they did was um you would bring it to this garbage place that they designated
and the lions club or you know some community organization would do you the favor of picking it up from there you really had to go out of your way to recycle
yeah you know and most people probably don't wanna carry a couple of bags worth of garbage in their car a few miles uh i mean it's all it's a good idea we should all do it uh but
um if it w- from a practical viewpoint from a selfish viewpoint if communities made it easy and convenient for you to do it they would have a lot more participation in my opinion
well around here i it's not too bad because on tuesdays you put out your paper and your cans and and plastic things and they go away so that i mean that's not too tough to put that at the end of your driveway
yeah
right
uh my friends in california have this special garbage fill where they collect all their soda cans and they kind of leave it near the dumpster knowing that the neighborhood kids will grab them because they can sell them or something for recycling
uh-huh
oh
gee you haven't
so they just leave it out for the vultures to take
gee kids around here i don't think would pay well wouldn't pay any attention to it they'd the dogs would get to it before they would i would imagine
oh well the soda cans where i live are good for a nickel a piece
wow
so if you bring them to the local supermarket they have these can crushers and you know you throw all the cans in one at a time it takes ti- a lot of time and uh you push a button and you get a nickel for every can because some- you had to pay a deposit on it when you bought it
oh
and you find these old old men and these bag people collecting all these things and hauling them in in big garbage bags and they just like take up one of these machines to to get you know couple of mo- uh bucks for beer or something
is that a city or state law that uh requires it to be recycled or
yeah it's a state well new york state does it and i know vermont a lot of the eastern states do it
huh [vocalized-noise]
so you get a lot of old people one old fellow had crates of beer he made friends with a barten- a bartender at some bar and he gets all the beer bottles because the guy can't be bothered with it
and he said he bought himself i said that's pretty heavy for you isn't it and he says well i just bought myself an old station wagon to cart you know this is a real business for him he's making big bucks
gee well i- i guess if you can buy in bulk it [noise] so to speak
[laughter] well i guess at a nickel a shot if these people are retired and they've got nothing better to do i mean they can come away with ten fifteen dollars at a haul i guess
well i bet that's resulted in uh i- it would seem to me that's resulted in some cleaner highways i would imagine
well you you do find people picking through the garbage pails at the beach you know my own kids have been guilty of that till they found that the bees were attracted to the coke cans and that was the end of that
[laughter] surprise surprise
[laughter] i think it's a fair you know for an eight year old to get three dollars it's like wow [laughter]
gee well that's uh well that you know a state law like that would probably encourage people down here uh to do it uh i mean i- i don't know
[noise] um basically what do you do to get your news
[noise]
well
most of my reading tends to be professional reading so [vocalized-noise] uh scanning headlines in the paper or reading over my wife's shoulder tends to be about the only newspaper stuff i do
uh and the newspaper is pretty much for local news anyway uh when it comes to national or statewide things uh i keep uh the national public radio station uh
um-hum
that's available here uh on all day
and uh that's pretty much where i get my uh both uh statewide and and national news coverage together with uh a little bit of t._v. news in the uh in the evenings
um-hum
but primarily from from radio uh which is you know that's a dosage of about uh
about two two and a half hours of news a day
depending on how long it takes you to get to work
w- well i it's on in my office and i can i can hear it as i'm working when i'm here [vocalized-noise] my commute is is about fifteen minutes uh so uh uh
[laughter]
[noise] oh okay
um-hum
you know that's not an issue but that's primarily you know where i end up getting it from
and and that f- for me is as much a a a choice because i find it to be a good way to do it as it is a response to limited time for doing reading and stuff
um-hum
it's probably more because i just enjoy the coverage than it is because i don't have time to read the paper you know
um-hum
well do you find that they uh tend to after a certain period of time broadcast the same thing over and over
well they do to some extent i- i hear some some repeats between uh uh the morning edition and the all things considered in the afternoon uh
i we do also have a re- an intentionally repeated coverage they start at five thirty in the morning and uh uh
they play the first you know hour again over at the tail end of the broadcast so that people who weren't up that early still get to hear it so some of it is intentionally repeated and and so once in a while i'll hear the same story twice
um-hum
or in the afternoon i'll hear the same report from the same correspondent in yugoslavia uh that they played in the morning so there is to some extent some repetition uh like that
um-hum
uh but uh for me it's better than trying to read uh time or newsweek or or u._s. news each week i tried that once and
uh w- if i have something to read i feel obligated to read it
um-hum
and uh then i felt guilty because i never had time to read everything that was in them
and so you threw the magazines away and wasted your money and [laughter]
yeah that was that was about it you know uh so now i'm saving trees and and uh by by not pub- subscribing to the magazines anymore but uh uh
[noise]
[laughter]
[laughter]
well how do you do it
well basically i get i listen to a._b._c. in the morning uh on th- the good morning america an- while i'm getting ready for work and other than that occasionally um i'll catch some news when i come home
my husband's a big news fan and he'll always have the news on but sometimes i'll get involved doing some other things and um
newspapers maybe on the weekend but during the week i just really don't have the time in the morning to get it uh and i'll listen to [vocalized-noise] news on the radio but just in the car radio going to and from work in between music
uh see [vocalized-noise] here we're in in mountain standard time and uh we- the few times when i've run into shows like good morning america uh
they've really been at the wrong time for me they seem to start very late for us and i got to be at work you know i'm leaving the house at like seven fifteen and so uh uh
um-hum
the some of them [vocalized-noise] seem to be you know like they don't come on until seven or something and and so there's not enough time an- uh to to watch it but they have so many other things that are thrown in
that you know i really don't care about you know how to make baked potatoes or or whatever uh or or or weather men with funny ha- uh wigs you know
[laughter]
[laughter] that's another channel [laughter]
you well yeah but the- they all the morning ones have a tendency to do a little bit of that
[laughter]
well this is true they wanna put a little humor in there
and
uh you know it's mostly just the timing they seem to be on so late in the morning that i- i started wondering to myself you know so who is it that watches these things but i think it's because of our particular time zone
uh it we don't go on daylight savings time and so everything gets shifted by an hour that may have been when i you know i looked in on it uh one time [vocalized-noise] it's just
uh you know for me a lot of what i look for in news is as much analysis kinds of things or uh
um-hum
sometimes human interest kinds of things that are a reflection of the news rather than just here's the events that happened uh i'm a real history nut and so
[noise] about you but i don't do whole lot [laughter]
[noise]
uh i don't do a whole lot mostly i you know
build stuff around the house uh kinds of things uh
oh yeah
yeah
wh- what have you done
that's
um not too much put some chairs and cabinets and stuff back together and you know some book shelves and
you know junk like that a little rack to hold the maps and you know mail stuff you know the uh stamps and all that kind of junk in to go hang in the kitchen
yeah
right
well that's cool
i used to do quite a bit when i was a little kid but um recently i haven't done much at all i- i did
uh i a while back i started refurbishing a piano we've had in our in our family for a long time it's an old antique upright
oh
and uh kind of started to do some work with and stuff [vocalized-noise]
sounds like a big project
uh yeah it is and i really haven't had time to do much with it
um it's a nice piano but it's just uh it's like uh like the intro said if you had more time and more tools you know
[laughter]
but uh other than that i- i haven't done a whole lot i did kind of make a coffee table out of a piano bench which was interesting
uh-huh
um and that worked out pretty well i actually gave that to a friend of mine since i really didn't have much use for it but uh
so y- you got your house then [vocalized-noise] work out
uh no we're renting a townhouse
[vocalized-noise]
um so we're just and i just kind of had to have some kind of piddling to do all the time
sure is that what you consider a hobby then for you
excuse me
would that would you consider that a hobby then
um i guess sort of it mainly just you know i've all kind of have something all the time
yeah yeah for me i don't know it's
my brother is a is a contractor and he actually does quite a bit of carpentry and wood work
uh-huh
so i don't see him very often but last time i did we did some stuff he uh he had a job where he's putting in tongue and grooves slaps for a a ceiling actually
and so i- i helped him do some of that and uh
uh-huh
and like that but aside from that i'm a i'm a student at the university of central florida
uh-huh oh that sounds good
[vocalized-noise] aside from my classes i don't do a lot of uh
of woodworking per say i've got a lot of other hobbies but not necessarily that so
yeah i- i guess it's kind of depends what your how loose your definition of woodworking is most of the stuff i do is not you know carving or anything like that it's mostly you know sawing stuff you know gluing putting things together that sort of stuff
right
i actually would like to do more of it though i kind of get into it it's it's fun to get started on something you know and and actually have a project that you're working on you know
yeah it's a lot of fun to have something that you're doing and uh you know it's when you're done with it there something there too
right you you've actually created something and had input into it
yeah
and also it's it i don't know i don't know about you but it's kind of neat to see something that you can create out wood you know it's like woe [laughter]
yeah [laughter] uh-huh
[laughter] didn't know you could do that
but uh and also some of the the little tools and and techniques that that carpenters use um my girlfriend's father is also is also a contractor in terms of carpentry and stuff
um-hum
and he'd made her bed and i was actually taking a look at it and some of the stuff uh you could see the techniques that he used to reinforce uh the braces and things like that
they're really pretty ingenious and [vocalized-noise]
i hadn't seen them anywhere else there were some some um timing bruce slots there and some things some particular methods that he'd used
um which were kind of neat and he's vietnamese so i'm wondering if if maybe the cultural difference made a made a difference in the way he worked at
yeah
um i didn't ask him about it but i
could be uh and seems like of uh stuff that people make with wood
you know up until a couple of hundred years ago you didn't have a a abundance of iron or steel to join them together with
right
yeah they had to kind of use some uh some different renovative kind of techniques to do that with
yeah
where do you where do you live again
uh the washington d._c. area
okay so i'm thinking that's primarily pine trees for the most part in that area
uh not too bad it's about i guess half and a half pine trees and various hard woods of you know
i'm thinking if you were to do something what kind of wood would you most likely use over there
and i guess uh really you can get any any wood that's available but i'm thinking in terms of cost pine pine would probably be cheapest there
yeah
yeah pine or possibly oak maybe but pine definitely
yeah oak is a lot better i think
yeah yeah making [vocalized-noise] pine seems hardly worth it because it's so soft yeah yeah
it's real soft and and kind of pliable and that's that's not real good but uh
it's easy to work with but usually it doesn't last because it comes apart
yeah i used to live in a before i moved up to minneapolis i- i lived in a a duplex in orlando
and uh that had some work that had to be done with it some of the the door frames and things and uh i did a little bit of that and that was kind of interesting too kind of fun
um-hum
but uh for the most part down there it's it's once again it's pine or oak
[noise]
[noise]
um
in texas they do have the um capital punishment and um
i- i jus- i i'm probably one that has to agree with it too um
there're
a- some things that go on that i just feel that
i- i just feel that that that that is a need i don't i don't know a lot of people don't feel that way either but i just feel th- that
well i don't know how much publicity it's gotten outside of the state but california we just put somebody to death
um-hum
um for i think it was a double murder uh to be honest i didn't pay that much attention uh to the details of it um
[noise]
but it had a lot of controversy out here uh basically because in california people like to protest about everything um
but i agree i believe that that there are a number of crimes that capital punishment is the best way to go um
um-hum
the big disagreement i have is that
in california the appeals process uh is so extensive and takes so long
that you end up spending a huge amount of money in like ten to fifteen years before you can actually you know put somebody to death for for a crime
yeah
yeah that is a consequence yeah
and i mean that's that's ridiculous i mean if you can you know y- y- the trial is supposed to prove you know within a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty
and then they have appeals well that's fine but it shouldn't take more than a few years i mean i should think two or three years maximum you should be able to know and you should be able to either put the guy to death
right
or he's innocent i mean it's if he's guilty for for you know multiple murders or whatever the case may be you know
right
um-hum
well maybe that's something that needs to be worked on but i i just feel that that
yeah
capital punishment needs to stay within the system not all states have them but i
you know was that was that the i'm not sure if that was in was that the man that that claimed he was abused or
yeah he was like um the the the defense the defense they're were giving given was that uh like his mother had had been an alcoholic when when she was pregnant with him and so he he wasn't you know mentally competent or anything else
and that he had some he
oh yeah
yeah
which is ridiculous and and the court found him competent um and he knew what he was doing and everything else i mean you know it was it was the best defense they could come up with
yeah
and how long had he been a- appealing how long was that
i forget i think it was something like twelve years or something
gosh boy
it was it was something really outrageous
yeah boy
well i mean and it seems like it it rarely does happen you know it's not it's not used that often you know at least here in texas but i think it's something that needs to stay i really do
yeah
i think in general uh
punishment in the united states is a lot weaker than it should be i mean it needs to be you know it's kind of like
the the the justice system in the united states is kind of like the dog poops on the carpet and you wait three months and then you put his nose in it and spank him for it
yeah
you know i mean there's there's no connection between the two
right right
yeah
i mean you take these you know most of the people who are committing violent crimes most of them not all by any means but you know a large percentage are the kind of people who are living very much day to day in the first place
um-hum
um they don't really see past next week much less next year and to say you know well if i kill somebody then a decade from now i might face the punishment
um-hum
yeah
that's not real it doesn't have any real impact on them
my sister and i were wondering about this recently because a an old friend of ours in california this jus- happened about a week ago um her husband just killed her and we're wondering if that has an effect
[noise] um-hum
if that if something does capital punishment
you know does it happen with that within that uh
i don't know [laughter]
um y- you mean would he be put to death for that
right
um largely depends on the circumstances and generally
you know from what i understand it's it's only the most brutal types of things usually where it's multiple you know
i think you're right
if if they can say things like you know well he was just you know temporarily insane because of some domestic squabble then
um-hum
you know they'll they'll give him you know twenty years with with parole in in twelve or something like that
yeah
yeah and uh i have an uncle that is an attorney that defends uh people on
[noise] uh i'm of the age that could have gone although i didn't and uh
[noise]
i guess um looking back on it i tend to think it was pretty uh
mostly a mistake
uh-huh
on the other hand
um the more i learn about the history the more i see it was
incremental uh decisions anyone of which was sort of understandable at the time
um-hum
and uh but on the whole i think it uh probably was the wrong thing to do
how about you
well i'm uh [noise]
i i was just uh in high school [noise] i guess when it when it ended ended up being i was in the last last lottery
um-hum
yeah
and i was glad it was over by then i've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there just because you know we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like
right
yeah
you know we um those people that i know i worked with several that were over there and [noise]
for some of them it was just kind of i don't know not so much a holiday i guess that's how they tend to talk about it
but that they just kind of lived out in the woods and every now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles and then they'd come back and you know
yeah
but that they weren't really allowed to do anything i uh to me it seems like we only went halfway if even halfway
yes
[noise]
yeah it's funny tonight i was um
[noise]
helping my kid with an essay on uh stalin
um-hum
and i was thinking
in the course of talking to him about it how uh
in world war two the personalties of stalin hitler and churchill
more or less defined the war and actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was uh
it was almost a personal struggle among these three uh i guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense [noise] um
um-hum
they're certainly all leaders and um and uh with their nations pretty pretty solidly behind each one of them
yeah
and i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the uh early decisions in the vietnam war that the uh [noise] people saw the cold war as uh you had to draw a line and and defend it
otherwise there'd be uh they'd get you someplace else
um-hum
[noise] looking back it seems like that was only partly true that uh there might have been a better place to draw the line um
i guess you can
i guess you can say that a a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight um
brought the cold war to an end but i don't think you can just fight anywhere just just in order to um call the bully out and beat him
and i have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the vietnamese war they felt like this was a place where we could draw a line beat them and they wouldn't come forward and uh we were wrong [laughter]
um-hum
but i um
you know the like how they said the more i hear about it
the more i can see each decision that was made as being understandable but the cumulative effect was to really get into a a hopeless situation
where and as you say uh going halfway was probably worse than um committing um committing to a completely and um winning it whatever that would mean
yeah well i- i- i think we did i think we did learn some lessons that we weren't uh
we weren't prepared for
i guess the best word is the atrocities of war
yeah [noise] huh yeah
uh i mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war i mean they you know they seemed like a valiant thing you knew you knew who was good you knew who was bad and it was a it was a traditional
yeah
the traditional battle of kind of good versus evil if you you know whichever way it is but in in in the vietnam war it seems like it was
well you're not y- you're
[noise] the sides and the lines that were drawn were all confused as to who's good and who's bad and
it's ambivalent yeah
and uh you know the even [noise] it seems like even the people you know had the south vietnamese the north vietnamese and
of course the laotians and the cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved but
what a- what about the domestic effects like [vocalized-noise] i was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it
uh possible and even popular to um [noise] criticize the government and they that pendulum started to swing um may- maybe even too far uh to the point where um
um supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional [laughter] from the vietnam war on and that tradition is still i mean it's dying now but it's still alive as opposed to
yeah
yeah
this desert storm stuff may have uh killed it but i think that was one of the biggest that you know the uh this domestic unrest that it
yeah [noise]
[noise] okay uh generally i get uh you know most of my news uh in the you know weekly magazines like time newsweek and and uh
[noise]
u._s. news and world report with with occasional smatterings of of uh you know the wall street journal and of course the local paper
um-hum
but uh my my only complaint is i really don't have enough time to to l- look at the articles every day and and go through a paper you know and exhaust their details so that's why i concentrate on weekly magazines
do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like
well yes i i well i- i don't think i have the time to really become a student in every article
[noise]
um-hum
and and so i- i i like the weekly magazines uh because i- it uh gives me you know the high points of what's going on uh
um-hum
but many times uh you know the the local uh local news kind of suffers you know but here i am you know cheek by jowl with our nation's capital
[laughter] oh that's right you're very close actually it's almost a uh bedroom community for the capital
uh
yeah they
yes [vocalized-noise] e- exactly well when they when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway i'm saying to myself hey guys i'm inside the beltway
[laughter]
[laughter]
but uh i- i- it turns out that uh that that the uh the c._n._n. is i think is great and for for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events
um-hum
but generally they're they're they're more sound bitish you know kind of thing and and i don't really uh you know i don't really feel as though i've gotten a sufficient uh you know dose of news that way
yeah a lot of my information comes from several sources probably pretty high up on the list is national public radio
um-hum
um which i like um i i think it's fairly objective and i always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative
yes
and while there's an inherent um filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read
um i always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of um favoring the other side that's that's potential indication of balance and generally i really do believe they are pretty balanced um
i also read time magazine and we get one of the daily newspapers uh around here where
we go through various sections of the uh various uh of the articles and the the front section and uh
well the mercury and the and the and the chronicle are the only things that are really c- can stand up there
oh
oh used to did you use to live around here
uh redwood city i use to work at anteks
oh okay oh yeah okay i know exactly where that is
a- anteks amdahl and places like that
yeah we we get the mercury which i generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper a- the newspaper i've really been impressed with when i've read it at times i- at well the los angeles times
yeah
um-hum
which i've found to be a [noise] a r- a very good quality um newspaper and i like a lot of the articles there th- the other thing when you said [vocalized-noise] we don't have cable t._v.
so but the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is is it called c-span
yes i i've i- i enjoy see they have uh we have the two the both c-spans here
both
but but really the the the on the public t._v. you know mcneil lehrer is one is an hours program that i always if if i watch any news program it'll be mcneil lehrer
um-hum
um-hum
and and occasionally c-span i- i like i- i saw the uh the uh the the tapes that were that were run of marion berry's drug bust was you know the whole thing was was run on that
oh i never saw that that would have been interesting
and and a- you know so they have the uh the uh uh parliament's question answer period it
yeah i i think that's always fascinat- i [vocalized-noise] i wish we had something
when wh- wh- when it first uh you know when i first tuned in on that i you know it's one that's i think it was somebody was just scariously just just ripping the hell out of some- another person and i and everybody was you know making noise in the background and then he w-
but it's usually the prime minister right it's thatcher major
yeah here's this dude in a wig and i said to myself it's another monty python that i didn't know about
[laughter]
[laughter]
and then and then up jumps margaret thatcher off her green bench and i said oh it's parliament [laughter]
[laughter] wh- which could be another variant of monty python [laughter]
[noise]
yeah so i- i thought to mys- i can't wait i'm going over to to britain in mid m- you know mid may i- i- i'm going to um you know a- you know app- approach my
uh you know this is how i discovered you know the que- the prime minister's you know question and answer period you know [vocalized-noise]
i i have seen that and uh a- aside from the level of wit which is much higher than generally in american politics um
which i really enjoy i really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard real questions i think and it's unlike the fairly controlled uh press conferences that presidents of the united states have here where they they always seem
yeah
[noise]
[noise] what do you think
well i think aids research should be funded more than it's currently being funded i think that
uh people including i mean mostly the government but also you know a lot of americans i think that it's a disease of of a certain population i meaning um homosexuals and and uh intravenous drug users
um-hum
right
in fact it is very much a a normal person's uh disease as well i think that we should fund much more
sure
right i think i- i agree with that to a certain degree
um certainly on an absolute scale it should be i- i think it should be funded more
on a relative scale um looking at it in comparison with other
problems and no it's not a big environment
i'm not so sure about that however
um yeah you're right definitely there's there's a definite um stigma out there that yeah it's it's it's limited exclusive to intravenous drugs users and homosexuals and um blacks or whatever
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
and that's not that's not the case anymore it may have started out that way even though there's there's still no proof of that
actually the most recent
um the that i've gotten is they're starting to look at um
well it started over in africa they're starting to look at
i believe
but believe it of monkey
yeah the [vocalized-noise] monkey i think
[vocalized-noise]
yeah there was some kind of research going on
and i can't remember what the exact uh gist of it was but something they hadn't considered before and it's like they now they're trying to go way back to the original
first outbreaks of it to see if they can uh nail down what [vocalized-noise] exactly it was
yeah yeah
but uh
well you know you have you have a point about you know where there's other issues that that need a lot of funding too and uh sure that is true
um-hum
but uh there's a lot of things that are funded and a lot of waste that can be redirected too [vocalized-noise] i think that that again that uh
oh sure
yeah
you know aids is is something that has to be dealt with by every person um and and not just in
understanding that it's you know can affect uh everyone
but in acting um in a uh you know sensible way to avoid uh the spread of this disease
yeah um-hum well i- i agree with that
um-hum
um the point i- i wanted to make was just strictly the environment like right now they say we've lost forty percent of the ozone layer just last year
um
in in se- in selected spots and that's really becoming a really big problem but that's not to down play the importance of aids research you know
sure
right right
um when you think about that importance you also have to consider that uh
not only is aids good in and of it's own but it also uh has a lot to deal with
um cancer and with mononucleosis and all the all the various diseases that affect the t. cell from a and the and the when the white cells of the immune system because all fairly interrelated
um-hum
right
right
so i think research on aids would benefit all that stuff
yeah good point um i- i think more often should go into you know aids uh education
yeah
oh yeah [laughter]
you know co- you know public service commercials um schools
um-hum
things like that
but it seems a lot like they're almost covering it up at this point [vocalized-noise]
yeah which is ridiculous
you you you really don't see a lot out there
it's like coming up with [vocalized-noise] plague you know no it's not happening
yeah [laughter]
uh disregard the you know [laughter] one out of two people dropping dead next to you you know
right you know that's that's for sure i- i like i said i go to school at u._c._f. in florida
and actually that kind of hits home because that kimberly begajah that had aids
uh and died from it she went to a dentist in stewart florida that's where she got it
right
right
and stewart's like three hours away from where i go to school
um-hum
right peop- i hear a lot more in local news about it
uh more than that i had a couple of friends who went to that dentist
yeah
interesting
yeah and they were definitely sweating bullets there for a while um and found out that they they were negative you know they didn't have any problems but um
uh-huh
right
you know boy talk about making you think twice before you go to the dentist
yeah
or any health care practitioner at this point
yeah i guess so
yeah because they really the last article i read on that they still hadn't figured out how she could've gotten it from him
um-hum
because he he as far as they could tell he sterilized the equipment he used gloves he did all the the proper precautions
um asides from telling his patients that he had aids
um but still that didn't make any difference they still got it so they they're not real sure how that how that worked
um-hum
right
but uh
yeah i'm i'm a lot more cautious of that but
[noise]
[noise] we're supposed to talk about if we agree on if we're paying too many taxes or if we're getting our monies worth out of the taxes we pay
right i think it's kind of a loaded question i don't think anybody would say we should pay more i think i think most of us feel that we do pay enough
no
yeah i think here in texas they're even running an ah a series right now on the news one of the news channels at night about they were like secretly um supervising people that were supposed to be working for a county here
um-hum
and they were hired by the st- state so they were being paid with our tax money
right
[noise] and they weren't even doing the job they were out working on other sites not doing a thing on what they were supposed to do
[noise] well i- i think what's happened is a lot of these state and city jobs people feel that once they get them they're entitled to them for life and they can kind of take it easy because they're protected by their unions etcetera
right
uh during my college years my mom worked for the state and she got me a summer job and when i came in i'm i was just a little eager beaver and i went through whatever work they gave me
and i found people sitting around me polishing their nails and
they were downright disgusted with me because i was going to come and go but they were going to live there and they didn't like me you know showing them up and finishing stuff so what they did was give me worse and worse and ugly and uglier things to do
so i would just back off bu- and you know that's what it seemed like from the inside um it's not that no one works i think what happens is it's a personality thing and those who just like to do a job well done get to do the work for three or four freeloaders
right
yeah
who don't do it i th- i- i you know i think it's a cross section of humanity it's not so much all state workers i mean it's hard to generalize like that
yeah i think that we pay enough taxes and i think that if if everybody would be honest with how they dealt with the tax money if we could somehow get the same um ability to
get work done and and be honest about it with our tax dollars i don't think they need to raise it and i think they'd be able to
handle with what we've got i feel like here in texas we pretty much get our monies back out of what we pay i feel very pleased with what they do they've put in
you know as far as the state taxes go i don't know about our federal money i think that's all pretty [laughter]
i hope that they're doing better with not spending so much more than what they've got but you know you just never you can't control that but in the state here
they've put in bike trails they've got really nice parks here in texas they keep their their their lots that they own that are green and stuff they keep them really nice
um their schools here are really good and updated they've got computers in the schools
i'm very pleased at least with the area that we're in with how they spend their money their their they don't tax us outrageously and they seem to really give us a lot for our tax dollars
they offer community classes for our kids to go to that are just very mi- minimal costs you know just cover the instructor
oh
and um there lots of opportunities that you can take advantage of there are community colleges here you can take for just practically nothing um they just offer so much for i feel like what we pay in our taxes that i don't mind paying them at all
apparently there's been a uh movement where i am i'm on long island which is a suburb of n- new york city
and um there's been a movement by home owners to try get their their home taxes reduced they feel their too high and there's all kind of review boards that if you feel strongly about it you can challenge your tax
uh the newspapers now running an article on state universities which you know everyone kind of ass- at least i did assume that you can get a good education and pay so much less than a private university
um-hum
and it seems to be more of an expose than anything i mean you hearing ghastly stories about kids who are taking four and fi- like five years to graduate because when they try to sign up for a class they're so over crowded they can't get in the class
[noise] yeah
so in order to finish all the uh requisites they have to just stay longer until they can finally get a hold of the class
right
that th- this i thought was totally outrageous that they have teaching assistants well that's that's an old thing you know having graduate students teach undergrads
but some of these people are you know from india and asia and they don't speak english well enough for the students to understand now how could they possibly have someone teaching a class who is not fluent
right
and and i heard that that's true i mean that's i find that incredible that's a [vocalized-noise]
so you're not as pleased with your tax dollars and what they're doing in new york
uh yeah well i guess i have a a private um
ar- argument with them i'm a substitute teacher who you know have have has raised a family my kids are older now and i'd like to work full-time and they're firing teachers left and right and the classes are getting bigger our school budgets are really down
yeah
maybe it's not handled real efficiently you know that's that's very likely
[vocalized-noise] that could be i don't know um
my you know my husband's in the computer business and the schools just you know they're updating computers are the hot new thing and my husband was
[noise] budgeting activity in our household i has is uh
[noise]
uh kind of an informal kind of situation we we you know put actually what happens is uh is my check gets automatically deposited i don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore it just gets deposited
[laughter]
[laughter] and and and and and and my my wife you know you know looks at all those bills that come in and you know and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them you see
and so our our budgeting w- we really don't have a formal budgeting situation every time i've ever tried one it's uh i've just got wrapped up in minutia and uh i've just decided not to pursue it uh what what's your budget situation
well actually uh
i've i've had a couple of different situations my current one has been the most successful uh at a certain point in life and my husband my ex-husband was an alcoholic and we got divorced back in the mid seventies and that left me with three teenagers
you know well a- a- actually that kind of situation is just a wonderful for budgets isn't it
[laughter] it certainly is [laughter] but at any rate what happened was that i- i just absolutely put away all the credit cards i didn't rip them up i didn't send them back nothing i just put them away
because there was one that it was really handy to have if i absolutely had to have something i could go use it
um-hum
but uh mostly we just spent cash whatever we had and if we didn't have it we absolutely didn't spend it but then as things improved you know once once i got them all through college
uh it came to the point where um my parents came through the depression i'm not sure how old you are
well my you know my my parents too you you you you were born in the in in the late thirties or early forties yeah
but my
late thirties yeah uh-huh and uh my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house
and that's kind of the way i was raised and so i'm not a very demanding person in in that aspect so for quite a period of time i just flat didn't spend any money now meanwhile i got had a building bank balance
hm
and my intent was that whenever something went on sale that i really had to have i would have the cash to buy it right then and there
um-hum
and not ever have to spend any money on interest
well that's that's good
and that's that's the way i've operated ever since then it and you know if if something goes on sale and i don't have the money i still don't buy it
well we we buy what well we just got through buying a twenty five foot refrigerator a new ceramic top stove and a new dishwasher
oh my [laughter]
and and we put twenty eight hundred dollars on the charge along with my trip to japan which was was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars and you know it's right i mean we just we got a monster you know bill coming in but but we also
oh my
oh my
have zero uh interest being paid and we pay it off as as it goes
uh-huh and that's the way i do my credit cards now
yeah so we never really get that much over uh over extended
yeah i do almost all my purchasing on credit cards but it's the fact that i have enough of a of a cushion in the bank so that when they come i can pay them in full
hm
yeah we're we're doing that we have you know uh th- this is our our our big uh we did redecorating two you know two new pieces in the re- in the family room and new carpet i mean we just uh we've just spent
[noise] oh my
spending spending spending
[laughter] i'm envious [laughter] well i [laughter]
bu- but but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've we've had two kids in college that have just uh graduated in the past year so we're you know we don't have that
uh-huh
it's time for you to do these things then right
yeah it's uh it's about time that we did that but the the the terrible part about it i've looked at it all and it all looks still pretty good to me why why do we need to replace it but
[laughter]
but un- but unfortunately my my my wife leigh feels as though it's it's just been an inappropriate uh thing to to i mean that rug is thirteen years old why not replace it i mean
i- i say it might go for another thirteen but uh too late we'll never find that out
[laughter] this is so funny that's wonderful but you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money
and
you need somebody to help you spend it i mean certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should be or not [laughter]
[noise] you know i- i- i don't spend that much money i just uh we we just sort of have had uh you know too many obligations to you know we sort of take care of the kids when they were in school and they they got through school and
that was the major you know decade of expenses you know
so we we feel as uh but as far as any formal budgeting uh you know i- i we just apparently have
been very fortunate when we went to wanna go out to eat we go out to eat and we never really you know have to program money for that or make choices
you know but uh we don't have that uproarious a a lifestyle after all we're we
[noise]
uh i don't know i can't give uh too good a perspective uh [laughter] how things have changed in ten twenty or thirty years [laughter]
[laughter]
well i guess uh
i guess the first thing [laughter] you know comes to mind would be how they've changed to the worst
yeah [laughter] how so
in a lot of ways
yeah well
yeah
[noise]
i guess break down of the family unit for one thing
um-hum
the uh
astounding drug use that's uh going on and
yeah
pretty depressing if you start thinking about it i guess
[laughter]
yeah it's uh i don't know it's you know i lived in basically it's a suburb of washington d._c.
um
um so i you know luckily i'm [noise] in a good area so you know i don't have to really deal with
a lot of the problems that d._c. has to deal but uh you know
yeah
uh kids are you know kids are bringing in guns into the grade schools and high schools and stuff [vocalized-noise]
you know trying to kill others kids and you know i- it's it's outrageous you know
unbelievable
like like you hit the nail on the head probably that all comes from you know lack of a good family structure
for this people you know they just
yeah i don't know which came first i don't know i think the drugs had a lot to do with it but
yeah yeah i don't you know
i don't know if that's a cause or an effect
[laughter] yeah that's that's the tricky thing trying to separate
figure out which is which um
but i don't know you know it i don't think there was much of a problem until crack started hitting the streets really
yeah
yeah because that's cheap and incredibly addictive and uh
you know that seems to be the target choice of the you know poor inter-city people
cocaine and marijuana i don't they really were after that i don't think they really touch that that much
however on the brighter side cars seems to be
performing a whole lot better
well that's true that's true
[laughter]
uh would kill for a dodge viper a the moment [laughter]
[laughter]
uh a pretty nice car
yeah
uh the uh
why the computers in the engines
you know they uh [noise] compensate the whatever problems come along until i just
um-hum
i make six and i'm a bitch though [laughter]
yeah it does i mean uh
but uh i do have a lot a lot help with those com- you know the curves giving a lot of information diagnostic
yeah yeah but doesn't uh help the home mechanic that much unless they've got a uh you know some way to decode all that information
sounds like my wife's car i just got uh
cadillac a used one eighty six and
um-hum
had a few things she had to get fixed on it and we just [vocalized-noise] so now you just pre- pressed a couple of the buttons up in the
uh
the air conditioning panel i think and uh and it reads out codes that way
um-hum
hum
and then of course have to decipher them
right
with the little book i use
hum interesting
but uh [noise]
yeah i don't know uh [vocalized-noise] [laughter]
[laughter]
street gangs and all that kind of stuff just
yeah
i think it comes back to the you know that the
family isn't
fulfilling the role it used to
yeah i- i think that's probably the key thing you know the key thing so you've got
single mothers who are trying to raise kids and you know are off working all day and the kids are on their own
you know that much guidance they're going to get into trouble and
you know now good stable family structure uh keep them straight or you know father figure to look up to or anything
well
[noise]
they get so much information from the
t._v. you know
um-hum
and uh
makes
i think part of the
parents
you know party and so forth and stands in the fact that they were
you know able to
teach them and tell them about things that and now the kids probably know more than the parents in a lot of cases
[laughter]
yeah about somethings but i don't you know
yeah
for the more important things about life i think uh a lot of kids are missing uh
right that's true
they're they're out for the the quick buck mentality
[vocalized-noise]
you know who they gets defined by what kind of tennis shoes they wear
[laughter]
and uh you know they they don't have
really kind of deep personal values anymore you know what
[noise] opinion on uh domestic or our policy towards uh latin america is that
[noise]
especially during the reagan now bush administrations
we seem to have a double standard in place over um how we treat them countries down there for example
a left wing regime or communist regime is god awful and uh basically uh you know satan incarnate
while nations like for a long time uh el salvador and uh uh guatemala
w- with right wing regimes we kind of just winked at things like death squads and alike yeah we found nicaragua to be the most horrible thing in the earth
right
and i just felt and it's the same thing with cuba that we we really seem to have this kind of double standard down there
whereas if your regime doesn't want to bother us a reason of threat to us we'll kind of ignore you
you can do whatever you want but if you invite the commies in you know look out
or if it it doesn't even have to be commies if it's just a little left of uh of uh what the prevailing attitude is in the united states it was bad somehow and
um certainly the right wing death squads were just as uh
[laughter]
deadly if not more so than anything set up by any of the left wing governments
uh and and that uh showed in the uh [vocalized-noise] who allowed to [vocalized-noise] to come into this country
um-hum
um
if people are coming from left wing countries uh it was viewed that they were
uh only seeking uh economic uh benefits and not actually escaping uh death threats
whereas if uh they were coming from ri- uh am i saying this correctly or if
i- if they were coming from um right wing regimes um
you wouldn't want them in
we wouldn't let them in yeah
yeah yeah it's like guate- how many guatemalan and el salvador refugees have we seen and heard about in the last ten years
yet nicaraguan refugees for the longest time were welcome with open arms as escapees and
um-hum
and and any communist type of regime down there i mean the whole the whole farce in granada
oh gosh what an embarrassment
right was it just
[laughter] i mean it was the most ridiculous thing and this is the kind of policy that we have down there i mean then we have this fake drug war [laughter]
no with uh
down there and that seems to be well we'll give you aid but oh no not to feed your people no we want you to clean up
uh our drug problem for us here's some money go shoot people with it you know [laughter]
right what was the whole thing with panama i mean here we were paying uh noriega for years
[vocalized-noise]
a- and then suddenly
we go in and bomb his country and uh
[laughter]
in panama and and and try and indite him i- i don't understand what that was all about
well it's the same thing that happened with iraq for years and years
here we are sending money over here playing these people off of each other it's was same thing in iraq playing saddam hussein o- off you know off of iran
in this case panama off of nicaragua and uh cuba and any of the other left wing regimes down there
here we are giving them all this money and they're crooks and then when they don't do something that's suitable to our particular policy we have to go and invade them [laughter]
and uh
and for what what does it leave us with absolutely nothing
i mean it wouldn't surprise me
it wouldn't have surprised me if uh noriega got off on all of the charges that you know instead of being found guilty and then let him go just isn't we're an embarrassment you know [laughter]
truly truly
and and i just think you know we have this kind of short term we are not interested in developing the region unless there's big business involved and wants to get involved down there
we we tend to treat them as sort of like a backyard and you know i'm just [vocalized-noise] just like mexico
right it's sort of it's our our little colony is that they do just if they provide the labor and the debiting of uh
of ford or uh uh
the
united fruit then that's fine
yep
but uh if they're actually trying to educate
[noise]
[noise]
well the soviet union uh now really called the commonwealth of independent states
um is a mess [laughter] um uh i think one of the biggest things we have to worry about is the uh control of nuclear arms especially ukraine and russia
yeah i my main concern right now is first of all at this point with the current government and situation i don't see them as any threat
to us at the moment however with the current state of the central government being as um tenuous as it is it wouldn't take much to uh cause a kind of fascist revival
within uh russia or any of the republics and then we do have a real clear foreign policy and a a problem and a threat
because of the number of nuclear weapons that are there we seem to have lost the ability to control what's going on in the country
right
and any country which has as many nuclear weapons as they do is certainly is a threat but perhaps not at this second
yeah you know i suppose you you say to yourself what will no rational uh person would would would launch uh nuclear weapons
um but i guess that that's wouldn't necessarily hold uh for some radical government or temporary take over even
well i work in international radio um and uh one of the groups that we're working with has been radio eurovan which is in armenia
and i you know in a sense you'd think being a you know an american or a westerner it would make sense that w- there is no real great threat that these people aren't nuts
but you listen to the what the armenians have to say about their neighbors the azerbaijanis and they launch in a second if they had an access to those weapons
right
[vocalized-noise]
there is a great deal of religious hatred in that part of the world and this is stuff that goes back to the days of christ i mean
yeah yeah
this is not a two hundred year or or a fifty year uh problem this goes back centuries and the amount of hatred
i mean there's accusations of using chemical weapons now bo- on both sides and
yes yeah
it into a republican strife amongst these various um former parts of the soviet union
i think you could have a regional use of nuclear weapons but i don't think that they see us as a threat anymore
right i guess i agree with that um
[noise]
um the other concern is as time goes on they could become an economic threat um but i think what will happen is they will go through an asian
[noise]
right
type of uh introduction into the business world where beginning there'll be cheap labor and uh y- you know then we will have an i'd say thirty years if things stay the way things are now
they could become another korea or malaysia or thailand type of [vocalized-noise] source for cheap labor where american products could be built
and uh i think that's where they are headed
right well i think that that there's a uh qualitative difference that uh russia and and much of the soviet union still has a lot of natural resources that some of these other countries you mentioned just never had
um-hum
so that uh [vocalized-noise] you know the commonwealth states could could easily you know leapfrog the uh
the you know stepping stone path uh laid out by the by the southeast asian countries
well they do have a huge oil reserve the problem is that they don't have the ability to exploit it at this point
right
they could become a major source for oil for us as well as timber
and um other products agriculture could become very important for them using modern farming techniques in the ukraine
and i suspect they will form some sort of economic union when all is said and done [vocalized-noise] i don't thi- i don't think
yeah yeah yeah we're we're still going through a a uh you know a settling period
you know they're not sure who they want their leaders to be they're not sure how they want the you know uh relationships between the states to to shape so i agree with you know they're they need another couple years to to let them uh settle down
and uh start cooperating
[noise] well i certainly hope that we will i- i wish we would incorporate some sort of marshall plan over there because i think one of the problems that this country has in dealing with them is we aren't doing enough right now
um-hum
and the chances for things getting out of control and another fascist type of regime rising are quite good
um anyone at this point who can give them food security and make them you know feel some pride again could become a major threat especially some of these republics
which are striving to become independent from central moscow and that kind of administration
um and if we don't get our tushes in there and spend more effort and money and funds trying to get things back on the ground there i think we're in
[noise]
[noise]
so uh what uh kind of clothing do you have to wear for work
[laughter]
well uh i bear a variety uh
i'm a supervisor out at t._i. so i wear anything from uh
jeans and uh a sport shirt to a you know
dress slacks or dress shirt
no coat and tie thanks goodness
yeah
i don't like those much myself [noise]
how about you
uh it's it's pretty casual uh
i usually uh
usually wear something like jeans sneakers
uh
kind of work you do
um i do engineering uh using uh computer operated and grading machines
oh yeah
and some of it so some of
i guess that would be pretty casual
yeah some of it's uh i mean i don't have to see customers or anything
yeah
but some of it's a little bit dirty you know you got all this machinery and stuff so you don't really want to be
wearing your
best stuff for that
well i was in the uh retail business for
about fifteen years so i uh
had my fill of coat and ties [laughter]
um yeah
fifteen years
yep
we- we- you supervising then too
i was uh store manager for kinney shoes
oh
i guess you'd say uh
supervisor
um some anyway yeah
not a topic you can get into very deep is it [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
so let's see wh- where did you you said you're in houston
yeah
so you don't have to dress very warmly i suppose
no we uh even this this year particular was real warm uh it didn't hardly get cold
not to wear a coat almost
really how how cold did it get
uh i don't we didn't even have a freeze i don't believe got down
about thirty
uh
below thirties is about the worst it did that i can remember
not very often at that
you say you have to wear a tie or no
no i don't huh-uh
ah that's good
fortunately
yeah
guess that can be pretty hot too
what'd you think about that thing out in l._a. [laughter]
which thing [laughter] they've got more than one
that verdict they came up with
oh
everybody's talking about that here
really yeah i guess it's uh
created quite a stir
yep
rioting and stuff
yeah i hear there's some uh
smaller amount going on in atlanta too
oh
i hadn't uh hadn't been paying that close attention to the news i guess i ought to tune in tonight
yeah
and what do you think about it
you think he was uh
you think it was a good
verdict or
yeah they uh acquitted the cops that supposed th-
beat him up
yeah
certainly by looking at the video tape it didn't seem
all that uh [laughter] reasonable but
yeah i think that's what surprised everybody was the fact they let them off after looking at the tape
um
course i guess there was a lot more uh to it
yeah must've been i guess
only saw you know a small part of the
the story
that is that what you're uh seeing on the t._v. now or
i'm sorry
is is that on the t._v. now why you mentioned it or
oh yeah it's been on there i was listening to it on a talk show on the way home from work tonight
yeah
hum
[noise]
yep
[noise] well i haven't had an awful lot of uh incidents in regarding child care when my two year old was in new orleans she got bit on the cheek and uh but uh that's about the the uh the extent of it
[noise]
[laughter]
but but but th- when i really am uh am concerned about is that uh so many of these child care places are are coming under uh uh you know investigation for for uh you know child molestation
uh-huh
and i and i and i'm saying to myself well you know y- you dump your your your little turnip off to uh you know this child care place and they don't pay very much
and wh- why why would they be interested in y- in your little turnip unless you know one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest you know
uh-huh
and uh that's a terrible kind of thing and i- i don't think my children have ever been subject to that but my wife didn't work and so we di- really didn't have that much exposure to it
uh-huh
well i am a working mother [laughter] i have three children and my children since i um since they were very young i've had va- various um different alternatives child care arrangements and
like most working mothers i i'm really not defensive about it i personally feel um in our particular situation i'm a much better mother when i work out of the home and
my kids i think are very very secure well raised children my comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune [laughter] over the years for a variety of opportunities
hm
so i i i uh you know it is a problem and but as you pointed out i th- i think the real problem is the low pay child care facilities and that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford
when our children were very young we had a pay a live in paid babysitter that was wonderful and then as they got older they went to uh i preferred to call them schools and they really were all day preschools and they were wonderful
hm
and i think they got exposed to a lot of neat things
oh well that's interesting
but we did we really truly did pay a fortune i mean we were paying
at one point
well about about c- uh close to about five hundred dollars a week for two children
oh my go- well you must have a just one hero ace professional job to support something like that
so
[laughter] well i'm a phys- i'm a physician uh and as is my husband and i and i felt very uh very good about working i'm a pediatrician actually
oh well yeah
um-hum
so uh but i think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children but and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for i think
well no- not all of us you know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for i'm an engineer and
[laughter]
oh
well i think it's real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in
and we had a really wonderful arrangement um i'm with the university actually and they had a wonderful uh program that started at age three
uh-huh
and it was about a block away from the hospital where i work and so many times at lunchtime i would go over and visit the children and eat with them and
see what they were doing and they had wonderful they had things like gardens and lots of pets and just they had a four to one uh teacher student ratio so that that sort of and a- most of the teachers had degrees um
yeah
five hundred dollars a week for two kids that's incredible
[laughter] yeah it was incredible actually [laughter] but it was good i mean it was it w- at that time there were two children and they were in special programs and each one was a little over two hundred a week and then in addition i paid a little bit extra
oh oh
but the kids were i mean they really had some great opportunities but tha- what you were alluding to earlier is you know women who work for minimal wage and
well
w-
yeah
and and really have t- feel they have to put their children sometimes they do put them in uh fairly low paying sit- situa-
you know they could
uh somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare and you know and that's a good starting wage but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care
uh-huh
um-hum
no even that
that really i think i don't it's been awhile since i've looked at my youngest child is eight so it's been a little while since i've looked into actually day care centers but they are you know the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week si- and so
[vocalized-noise]
i mean we used to pay pay fifty cents an hour to babysit but mi- mine are twenty two twenty three and twenty seven so you know that i guess babysitters now are up at what five dollars an hour
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter] something like
oh my
[noise]
well you know but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children i mean it has been a real um th- there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences and i think
i think they have captured a certain market again bu- but then there are babysitting groups as a pediatrician one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections as you start putting lots of little kids together the infection rates that go around and
um-hum
oh yeah
[noise]
[noise]
okay uh
so your you you i guess uh you're probably in the same uh same situation uh we're in we're kind of past having to provide child care our our kids are grown up we don't have any grandchildren yet but uh uh they're
uh-huh [noise] how old are your children
uh one's twenty six and the other is uh twenty twenty one
[noise] uh-huh
so they're uh um
well they're gonna be getting there [noise]
they're they're getting there you know there no no no prospects right away for anything to happen but uh
yeah
uh uh-huh oh i see
i have uh five children i have a eighteen year old son the rest of my girls are like twenty three twenty six twenty eight and twenty nine and i have three granddaughters right now
um-hum
oh
and uh i uh one's in iowa
um-hum
and uh she's she's a teacher and what she does is she teaches at a preschool an-
oh okay
and so she kind of and they let her bring her her little daughter in for free and then so the they're kind of but she just works part time
um-hum
um-hum
then i have another daughter in uh bountiful utah and she has to work full time and it's just tearing her apart she has a private baby sitter
yeah
and uh the baby just screams i mean the baby is like seventeen months and she just screams we even she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there they're not even there yet
um-hum
um-hum
you know
yeah that's hard we've
and and then i have my um um i have a seven month old granddaughter and uh her mother stays home and she they live wi- that they live with us you know as in orange county is really expensive
um-hum
um-hum
they live with us and so of course we love it because we get to see this cute little baby all the time but um uh she just um she used to work in pre- in the preschool
and and and child care and she says after working in there and and you know here she was a provider
but you know there's only so much one person can do
yeah
she says it's so awful she said she'll never put her child in a in a in a preca- in a p- in a preschool
um-hum
i'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere but it's really it's really really very difficult and
um
yeah now what did you do when your kids were growing up were you
well
when when uh the first uh ten years see first ten or twelve years i stayed home
uh-huh
and um and then after that i i went to work and um uh uh a couple times i just uh
uh-huh
um you know th- then i had one job and then that job ran out because it's kind of a government seeded type job and then and then like about la- later i
i tried to get the baby to a babysitter -posed to be good uh recommended person from the church and i knew her personally she have two kids of her own and everything but i quit my job because i couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child
um-hum
i mean first of all uh you know her children were sick all the time so when my son stayed over there he got sick same thing same thing that the her kids had right
you got sick yeah
right well
and so um we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock then he she'd take my son and her daughter over t- to kindergarten
but sh- uh that day um i was saying now he he's sick and she goes well because he has the same thing that all my kids have that's what he got
you know i goes well okay so it's not like he's gonna infect her kids but then what happened was is i said uh he just threw up and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty so she said well she'll keep him home and he'll probably just sleep anyway
well you know what that woman sent her sent him to kindergarten
she sent him to kindergarten as soon as he went there the teacher took one look at him and he threw up again and they put him in the nursery i mean they put him in the nurse's office
guess so yeah
and then what happened was is you know they gave her a call because they knew that she was my babysitter called her and they said um
that he's sick well she wasn't home
um
i mean her all her kids are sick but she wasn't home right and her and her her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick
now why didn't he why didn't she keep him home with her no she didn't do that so it got to the point where he he's -posed to get out of uh kindergarten like about two thirty
and i had to leave work it was it was five o'clock in the evening and i found out he was still there at school
and they were calling me and they says somebody's got to pick him up and i kept thinking that she was gonna get picked up
she was gonna pick him up because she only lives in you know like two blocks away from the school i was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff and he had a hundred and four fever they couldn't
uh to give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything i was so furious i i quit that job and i stayed home for a while longer then i went and got a um a job in real estate where i can kind of adjust my time a little bit better
right
yeah a li- little bit more flexibility you can come and go
yeah but uh i haven't had any good really very good experience with child care
yeah
well when our kids were small we had a couple of uh good good women who uh would often co- uh get them to come to the house and and take care o-
[noise] [noise]
[noise] okay well what's happening in new york [laughter] well that's what we're doing too on our our current events and it's all over the
oh what's happening in new york we're all reading about los angeles i think
of course the t._v. and we're having a little bit of uh uh you know demonstrations here in dallas but not anything like they're having in l._a.
i should hope not
[vocalized-noise] really
i- i- i was just reading this morning in the paper that it's also spreading to san francisco as well
oh is that right well it
the rioting and all that kind of thing
uh-huh and last night it was going into some of the nicer areas too you know uh rather than just staying in the
in the uh in the sections that it started in
hm
[noise]
but uh i get my current events um all three ways you know talking to people uh some t._v. although not much t._v. and uh reading the paper
do you get
and
uh i'm big on the morning radio i guess i wo- get woken up by the alarm and catch the day's news real quickly
well that's something i used to do when i had a long drive to work or a or a maybe a thirty or forty minute drive to work i would turn the the news on and listen to that all the way
uh-huh
but i don't do that anymore it's just that i guess a habit i've gotten ou- out of and that's uh that's a real good way to get everything recapped
you know i was just doing some thinking recently on we only hear
we hear the news in a slanted fashion by how it's reported to us
uh-huh
i was looking at this morning's paper and you see uh you know the cover photo is
a truck and and in the background everything's in flames
um-hum
and i think they kind of uh set you up in a way
well i know they do [laughter]
i was uh i worked in public relations for um a a safeway stores which was a is a big grocery chain in used to be in this area it's not here any longer and it used to be in new york i don't know there
yeah i've heard of it
and uh i was their uh press person uh public relations person for about five years and handled all of the press
and i would tell them one thing on the phone very carefully
um-hum
uh and they would report it
not so carefully and in different context you had to be so careful uh whenever there was an interview on television uh they would tape a interview ask you lots of questions and then they would just take excerpts out that
uh you know [noise] standing alone wou- didn't mean the same thing
and so but we just really you really had a we had a tough time uh
relating to what you actually what was actually going on as to what was being reported
um i i think uh the news is starting to think of itself as theater
well i think you're you may be right there too uh and i can see where
did you happen to hear the uh interview of the uh juror
no no no
uh last night on t._v.
she said that the public saw only a small portion of that tape
now i you know on this rodney king
um-hum
now i can't side with her
you know [laughter]
because they -ey you know you can s- see what was happening and that's totally wrong
but you know we were shown just a portion of something we weren't shown a whole picture
we- well something i read in the paper was you know if you just hear the headlines you don't know that there were three other people in the car that was stopped who got out put their hands up and said okay we give up
um-hum
that's exactly right
you know and they don't tell you that that makes you so angry to think that oh they beat on this poor man
um-hum
this one person
but he he had a choice to you know this all could have been you know avoided if he had behaved himself i i i believe they overreacted horribly
exactly
right
but you know if you think of the cop's point of view he has a wife and two kids and he wants to get home tonight and he doesn't know how crazy this guy is
exactly and he's resisting
so everybody's fighting for their life and you can see how this can get out of hand
um-hum exactly
but
but like you said we were not shown that we were not uh unless we you know read in-depth you you get that you don't get that impression and so that makes everybody up in arms
i've been very annoyed lately by the sensationalism that's going on
i was uh visiting some friends over the easter vacation in cal- in uh california near san francisco
and the big thing out there was they were finally after twenty five years going to execute someone
um-hum
uh whereas they've always had a death pentalty penalty they always put it off
um-hum
and she had the t._v. on and they go to s- they go on to say well the cyanide came into the room and after about a minute his head slumped and they went into gr- gross detail
um-hum
i mean why is this on t._v. is this news do we want to know it
right [laughter]
it was disgusting and this whole thing with willie kennedy smith you know did he rape this girl did he not why is that headline news
um-hum
well it wouldn't be if it was anyone else
yeah but i mean i think the newspapers are irrespon-
it wouldn't have been if it
[noise] [vocalized-noise]
[noise] okay well um i'll let you start i guess
well uh [noise] yeah i'm i'm employed by a company that does do uh random drug testing and i've got some very definite uh opinions about it uh
yeah
which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from from when they when they announced it but uh
developed a little more i guess but haven't changed that much what about you are you uh in- involved at all
uh no i mean i'm not my employer does not do that um although um
uh i had an ex-employer that uh the previous job i used to have uh they've after i- i guess a few years after i'd started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test
yes
uh i- i don't know my feeling is that uh certain jobs that when there's uh immediate threat to life and limb um if should somebody be under the influence of drugs
i i'd be willing to support that for example um [noise]
uh well um
[noise] uh train engineers because it you know uh like there was an incident several years ago where an amtrak engineer would
yeah
right
you know he crashed and [noise] killed some people because he was uh smoking some marijuana and [noise] i guess air traffic controllers i wouldn't want them to be [vocalized-noise] on drugs uh and airplane pilots but where it's not necessary
uh in that regard where there's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property uh i i'd s- i would seriously question it uh
yeah
yeah
so
yeah it uh
that's that's mine it it you know i- i go back it to me i-
it no matter how much the [vocalized-noise] yeah our company claims that it's not a constitutional issue that because this is uh between uh a company and an employee it is not
it's not a government it's not the constitution doesn't apply but it
[noise] it's it seems to me that it's still should i o- our company's doing it because they're a uh government contractor
[laughter] uh and so it's it's required for certain some form some form of
drug program is required to get the government contracts and i'd i'd
so it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent
i- i- it yes okay an- and our company has taken that and gone all the way say okay uh first off
we don't we don't have enough courage to uh
pick out the people that that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage
uh because that would offend them uh if they if they weren't so we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even
uh and and uh
yeah
well i-
the- then uh but and they've so it's a a complete random testing we- well it's random in the sense that you don't know when it is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested
huh
um and uh you know i i sit at a terminal and and write software all day it it uh
certainly ha- has no life threatening uh capabilities uh
right and
you know in in my job and and uh yes i i agree that there are there are um
[vocalized-noise] jobs that are definitely life threatening and and and th- there needs to be a line drawn somewhere at wea- reasonable and proper it you know
yeah yeah i agree i mean it's
well there's also the issue of uh [vocalized-noise] out here i remember hearing a year or so ago that uh a lot of there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results you know or or i shouldn't say high i mean several percent [noise]
well
yeah i that that i that i will give credit to to our our company for in that that
[vocalized-noise] i think there's there's a a couple of levels of tests in terms of of uh
of drugs and [vocalized-noise] essentially the first thing is tha- is on the order of you dunk litmus paper in the in the urine and and or some you know it's not quite that simple but it's fairly simple
kind of a coarse kind of test
ye- o- coarse kind of test and then there's a a much more um
uh refined test uh
uh spectrography or wh- whatever it's called they chromato- chromatography uh to determine exactly what the what the things are and uh
is that done o- right
now le- let me ask you this um uh
at the time you hired on with this company uh was that prior to any
no i i've been with this company for uh for sixteen years now and uh
okay so that th- uh this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this [laughter]
[noise] no and it and it and it has it has you know th- they did that three or four years before they did it di- with everybody and i um
at that time i could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you don't you don't know but on the other hand uh someone new coming in that knows they're gonna have a test that's that's
[noise] i know uh product quality first of all i have had to return products uh generally those products that i bought mail order recently
[noise]
um-hum
well i think that you know brand name products that we've become familiar with have in most cases you know gotten better
i think that we have a problem in this country with consumer protection laws and the lack thereof
yeah i agree with you yeah
f- for a lot of things there's some real junky mail order places out there um that we've ordered from
in the past and ended up with not what we expected and having an absolute nightmare especially in dealing with a mail order in trying to return a product and get satisfaction
i it it seems like every time i turn around i have to write one of my world famous complaint letters to try and resolve these situations with these kinds of mail order places
yeah
uh but you know generally speaking i think products in most cases have gotten better than they were in the in the past
yeah yeah i agree with you there yeah um usually i think it's it's not even the manufacturer so much as it's where you yes well like like where with you buy your stuff i guess a lot of your stuff mail order
but if you buy it like if you go to like a uh a retail place like i don't know uh uh uh silo or one of these [vocalized-noise] you know they're usually the ones that are giving you the you know they give you a hard time
yeah
oh yeah i'm not happy at all with silo i [vocalized-noise] we have every time you look around and there there's a price that's better somewhere else
i there's a lot of rip-offs out there uh even in [vocalized-noise] parts of the retail uh community as far as uh you know they there seems to be this real lack of ability in dealing well with customer service
right
with and product support for a lot of these products i remembered when i you know certain product names where you'd get the product and immediately there's a problem with it and it needs to be upgraded and
suddenly it's your responsibility to pay all of this money to have it done when it was their fault to begin with
right yeah yeah
that that really irks me and i you know i'm not use to that and with technology you know i've had some answering machines here die very quickly yet other brand names you know panasonic and that that little that i can drop on the floor and they still work
yeah
it you you really these days because we don't everything's been deregulated we don't seem to care as much about consumer protection
if you aren't ultrawise uh in shopping and looking for products you're in real trouble
uh yeah i agree with you
[vocalized-noise] i mean you have to have your consumer reports you got to have um you know david horowitz and and all these things it's just to buy something i mean the the amount of money you have to spend on some of this high technology
yeah
[laughter]
today and then you have these brand names that attempt to mimic the the these brand names that we know
right
and then you're you're if you're not informed as a consumer you end up with absolute junk
yeah it's it's true that's happened to me i'm i mean i've gone uh when when walkman's first came out uh i- i think i had i bought two when they first came out i just a radio one and then i had a radio and a cassette one and or just the cassette one
[noise]
um-hum
and uh the one was panasonic and the other one was like not even a brand name but those both lasted me for like three years and then i mean then within the past year and a half two years i've probably gone through about six of them
[laughter]
yeah
you know and and i really don't think i'm abusive or any [noise] i'm not you know
well yeah they do they wear out i we've just had an r._c._a. television that we bought two years ago go up and just decide [vocalized-noise] i'm not working anymore and you know before you buy t._v. it's like ten fifteen years
they're just
uh-huh
[noise]
yeah yeah [noise]
but now i mean two years we're having trouble excuse me [noise]
[noise]
yeah yeah i mean that's really um
[noise]
it's it's [vocalized-noise] it's even with cars now too i mean it it in every area in every any kind of product [noise]
[noise]
oh yeah
i mean we have a buick uh eighty five park avenue that you know once you past the three year point everything just started falling apart
yeah
and and by the time we're done i mean we could've bought a whole new car [laughter] for the amount of money
[noise] yeah it's yeah it's true sad but it's
yeah you know and uh how about these places where you go like out in silo i think it's silo no uh
there is a store uh the appliance store i don't i don't think i think their local is just uh western pennsylvania but uh whenever you go there they try to sell you the insurance you know
oh yes
you know where you want to extend your warranty of course i'm i know other places do this too you know [noise]
[noise]
oh yeah the the worst value is because if something goes wrong it's generally in the first thirty or sixty days that you own it
right
oh they do that on v._c._r. and it's high pressure i mean it's like well you know you must be stupid if you're not going to buy this [noise] why [noise]
right
yeah yeah they really try to you know tack on another fifty sixty dollars
we ha-
[noise] are you in the middle of anything
[noise] uh no i'm not in the middle of anything i've just about the last thing i did about maybe
oh close to a year ago now i guess i'd i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house
so i guess that was yeah that was that was fairly large undertaking a a it's it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house
the whole thing
did the framing and all
oh we did it all except for the sheetrocking that was the only thing we didn't you know putting the ceiling up and things like that we don't we we weren't sure how to do that [vocalized-noise]
huh
maybe you and i should get together because when i had my last big project i had the contractor do the framing and i did all the sheetrocking and the interior work
[laughter] yeah that's the exact opposite we did all put the roof up and did all the roofing and the
put all the interior walls up we just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work and that's it because you have you know get those joints to go together and
and whatever you have to put in there to get the shee- to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that i didn't we didn't know a thing about any of that and so
yeah
my wife wishes i hadn't done that
[laughter]
[laughter]
it's it looked very hard to do so we figured well just i don't think we could do it and make it look professional so we left it left it to somebody who does it for a living but
i think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy
probably so and i'd we'd never done it so we just left it alone but that's i guess so i'm only twenty one so
[noise]
yeah
i my my vast experience of of home home owner's knowledge is not very much so it's just what i have to do more or less around the house you know for my parents so
did you you framed it in fr- uh on on you framed in new square footage or was it stuff that was already uh enclo- brand new so y-
it was brand new we started with th- the backyard and turned it into part of the house so it was
[vocalized-noise] and you knew how you knew how to do the framing
um well my dad knew how to do most of it you know he
uh-huh
he had we'd gotten a couple of books and then he just started doing it i don't know he well he did all the flooring himself he put the whole the whole floor in and then i just started with the walls and the roof and started there and then we were put us like a
not not necessarily a garage but just like a off the side of that after we had the house part made we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less it's not you know it's not enclosed it's just
somewhere to drive another car to to park and it's
d- do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground
uh it's off the ground
on the piers
uh-huh it's on about uh twenty two inch piers something like that
did
you had those poured or you did them yourself
so uh no those a- those are we did those ourselves
you just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete
[noise] so
yeah exactly so it's
huh
well the last thing i did completely myself was an outside deck which i was pretty proud of [noise]
yeah those are those are we'd do- i've done one i helped somebody do one of those before those are those are you know you can buy them in kits but we didn't do that way but it's yeah
no i designed it from scratch and did a pre- did a pretty good job those are nice though they're pretty forgiving you know you can always tear stuff out and redo it it's a
yeah yeah that is not near like building a house or anything but yeah those are nice especially when you get done you got something
[noise] right [noise]
you know i don't know i like them you just sit out on the on the deck and do whatever have a barbecue or
yeah
i've
i built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and uh a backrest and all that stuff i'm
yeah that sounds nice all done by yourself huh designed
yeah we had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes so we could pour concrete and support it with a a nice firm four by four posts and uh
yeah
and then the rest of it i just did a a contractor friend helped me uh with some of the um foundation work but uh it's pretty s- it was about four or five hundred square feet the same size as the addition that i just put on so
yeah that's a pretty that's a good size deck
[noise] yeah it's uh not that expensive i think it will cost me three dollars a square foot and uh you know it no less than that co- cost me about five hundred dollars six hundred dollars all together
so yeah that's
yeah that's right
yeah that's good that's not bad at all you didn't have to
yeah
the the wood man it's it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is you know to get to get good lumber it costs i don't know about dallas but around even in this little town it's it's not cheap at all i was surprised
yeah
i'd be surprised if it wasn't uh cheaper where you are well yeah it probably comes from where you are
it's probably more there
[laughter] yeah that that it probably does i i don- not sure but
most
[noise]
when i drive through that area that's all i see is
[noise] yeah it's nothing but woods up here down here
pressure treated pressure treated lumber yards yeah
yeah
[laughter] [noise]
well i don't i haven't i mean i haven't i used to live in dallas in arlington actually and but that was just when i was a kid so i don't really know what the cost of living is even like in dallas anymore but
uh-huh
it's i don't know we're a college town so that doesn't help us out any because we we have gas is a dollar t- dollar twelve a gallon so that's probably about what you're paying so
right east texas
huh
yeah my current project is a walkway which i'm building around the house and out to the backyard to um you know
digging it out and laying sand and putting uh pavers on top of that so that's a a lot easier
yeah
you got something going all the time
[noise]
[noise]
uh with regard to uh to jury trials i you know i- i really feel as though uh jury trials are are uh whatever system has been been used historically in particular jurisdiction
you know is really the the only kinds of things that you can use because the the jurisprudence is you know based on on uh you know on accumulated [vocalized-noise] body of law
and if if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they they start they could start going back and digging up all these cases
that uh that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards so i- i really don't think it th- they can really do much of anything to change it what do you think
[noise]
um i i don't think so possibly in the jury selection would be the only
just for example what we're seeing in california i guess
yeah it makes you wonder um had the jury been a different group of people
what would've happened with that outcome um
and [vocalized-noise] and the problems that that has come
that has come from this decision that that jury came to after all of us witnessed what we did with the video tape beating um
just makes you wonder i guess whether or not they
well won't well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that but then then you know the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently
um-hum
that's that
and you know the other two guys sat in the car
um-hum
and they didn't get beat up
no
you know rodney got beat up because he he you know he pur- you know he involved himself in some sub self-destructive behavior
um-hum
and uh um
just like the burning and looting is self-destruct everybody says well this is the nineties and they're gonna rebuild and it'll be even better
uh-huh
oh yes
hey what do you think you know some some black guy with capital is gonna come in and invest in that area
uh
that's right
with everybody with that mindset they they're they're gonna that whole area is gonna be turned into residential ghetto you know and a- you might even be able to to use it for for a bombing test site you know
they're only gonna suffer
yeah they're only gonna suffer they they've defeated themselves with with their looting and violence um
i understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or uh don't live there or whatever
we all saw the same thing on the on the tape and um
well e- everybody's saying this is gonna be a new era we're gonna reexamine this thing
hey the bu- the average person is gonna take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed they're a bunch of animals
you know how can you really deal with an environment where you're gonna lose everything
forty deaths i mean there are forty people that are dead as a result of that
i know
that's really ridiculous
and i'm just trying to determine you know how you address and how you weigh you know rodney getting getting the the hell beat out of him against you know forty deaths
against forty other people being
yeah and there's no other i i'm not su- exactly sure uh what the circumstances surrounding the deaths
and i'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and and pursued it you know because i'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing
those deaths
um-hum
is it a looter that got shot by a store owner
or just a by- an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what um
i you know no tears
yeah and and so i but i i suspect a number of them you know you you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot you know in in the street
it uh or or beaten
and and my reaction is i would've run over fifty people before rather than stop
and uh and th- there would've been just uh nothing but carnage after after if i'd been at the wheel no one would've stopped me
right
that's that's exactly how i feel too i wouldn't have uh they wouldn't have stopped my car for any anything had i seen them coming but i was just wondering since you were you're in you're back east um
and a little closer to the the bigger cities probably than we are in idaho here
right i'm inside the beltway
oh
you know how capital gang they always say well inside the beltway they think thus and so and i say well wait a minute i'm inside the beltway and i don't think like that
um-hum oh in what uh section of the government do you work
i'm a government employee
i'm with the f._b._i.
oh oh that's interesting
yes an- and so um
uh and and the reason i'm doing this whole thing is because you know rick who is another government employee wanted a spee- segments of my speech that uh were done a year ago and he wanted another collection a year later
uh-huh
oh
and so this is my seventh call a year ago i did eleven calls
oh i see
and so that's that's why uh
uh tha- that's why i'm religiously getting on the phone because i have a unique you know i have a unique situation here in that if i don't participate
um-hum
[noise] do you happen to have a system for budgeting your money
[noise]
um
just sweared i heard that beep but usually
you can hear the tape or you can hear it starting [noise] um
oh i've never go ahead
uh no [laughter] no i am a very organized person that believes i ought to have all those things and we don't
[laughter]
[laughter]
uh-huh so you it's not just you you have a family
[vocalized-noise]
yes i'm married i have two kids um young four and a half and three and [vocalized-noise]
as far as sitting down and putting a formal budget paper and pen you know and following it no we don't do that
um i have a very good idea of what our expenses are and how much we can afford to spend and can't spend and
you know so i- it's not like we just totally don't have a clue as to what's going on but i wish we were a little more organized a little more
you know when i think about it there are certain parameters we work about
faithful to a budget
but we don't have a budget where it says its so much for this and so much for that but we do put a certain amount in checking account each month which we should pay for the mortgage and the electric bill and all that
right
and i know there's a certain number i put on my grocery and pocket money
and sometimes i have a little left over and i kind of put it away but the next week i pull it out and add it to that number
[laughter]
right
and i know that i don't go above that and i know that when we empty out the mortgage and the electric bill money and all that that you know
you got to stop spending but you know i- i don't know if i can say i guess with the grocery and pocket money i do have a particular number but
that's right that's right
you know you never know if if you own a home you never know if something's going to break and you're gonna need more
that's right well it's very difficult my husband is i- is self-employed he's in uh financial planning and and so all of his income is commissions
it's very hard to sit down and budget because you don't know what he's going to make uh you know we kind of think you know he usually brings home at least this much and i can base you know base it from there
right
but there's months that he brings home uh you know three times that much and there's some months he doesn't bring home anything it just depends on where the commissions fall and so you kind of have to you know i ha- in in my mind i know the basics i know what we've got to meet each month
you know and and my salary helps towards that because mine's set you know but um
i think that we could probably save a little better or afford to do more things for fun that we'd like to do if i did follow a [noise] you know pencil and paper budget but
do you folks get to save
[noise] well differently i mean do i have a savings account sitting in the bank no but uh we do have you know universal life insurance on him we have um
a 401k a coda plan preretirement plan on me through my work uh so there are things that we have money invested in you know i have a profit sharing and pension uh savings more toward retirement
now savings sitting at the bank that hey let's plan a vacation no when we decide we wanna do something like that we start saving for that and when we get it we go
right you know cause i i'm finding more and more that people don't have so many dollars left after they spend on what they have to spend i
i think it's the rare person who says well i'm just putting money away for my kids and and every week puts in fifty dollars or something i don- i think people aren't having much left at all nowadays
right
i think it's more and more difficult i do have savings accounts for my kids at work
and um and i use that for their uh life insurance investments uh but
i also pull from that and from mine if we need the money you know if you need it for something or like you said the something comes up on the house and you've got to have it well you go deplete those funds and use it you know
right that come from somewhere
yeah i work part time i'm a substitute art teacher
oh
so you know we try to live on my husband's salary and when i want something frivolous that he probably wouldn't agree to i just you know spend my own money or chip it in when you know something big comes up
that's true yeah
now we have an interesting arrangement my husband loves golf
and i'm glad he ha- i mean it's his release it's his time each week where he's not dad and he's not husband and he's not employee and he you know what i'm saying it's just a release
i thought you said when he's not dead [laughter] not dad [laughter] well jeez [laughter]
and no dad [laughter] dad [laughter] not dead [laughter] i'll have to work on that uh
and and i'm glad he has that i'm glad he enjoys it but i used to resent it because i felt like all of our spare money went to his golf [noise]
i don't particularly have anything i like to do from week to week or day to day or or anything like that and that's fine
um and so what i started doing and he's never said you know if i wanted something i'd look in the checkbook because i'm to practical and say nah i'd better not spend the money
uh-huh
well he's never held me back you know he's always said if you want something go get it
but i didn't feel comfortable so now when he goes and golfs i take you know if he takes out ten bucks or fifteen bucks or twenty bucks i take the same amount and i stick it in a savings account that i have at the credit union at work
oh
and i save for something i want becau-
[noise]
-perience with um
uh dealings in government are that i'm one of these three million dish owners in this country
and we've been fighting since about nineteen eighty six to try and get some legislation enacted against some of these cable companies and how they've been stumping on their competition and what little there is
and it's a very pro consumer type of legislation but we're constantly running into trouble trying to get it passed because we're up against huge pack money donations from the cable t._v. industry
uh-huh
in this country and i've come to learn that a lot of these politicians unless you can mobilize enough consumers
or voters to make a stink about an issue if there's a big pack check involved they'll take the check every single time
uh i guess it's not totally
not understandable [laughter] you know i'm i'm sure that if you're looking at whether or not you're going to get elected and have enough money to run that they've got to uh got to take that into consideration
oh sure but i think it goes i you know a little of it obviously is they're getting themselves prepared for when they're out of office when they become consultants or high-powered lobbyists themselves
and uh i- i think that although some of the people that we have in elected office are upstanding honest people i think that as they're in the system from longer and longer
they get corrupted by it basically by losing touch with the people that they're supposed to be serving and i think they forget who it is they're supposed to be representing
it's uh well it it's it's such a complicated thing and let me just relate to you uh
an experience that i had with politics at a lower level uh and i think what it boils down to is that if you can't find compromise that you're not going to be successful
um-hum
um [noise] in eighty six i was president of of an association called the d._p._m._a. data processing management association
um-hum
uh which was actually at the time we were the third largest chapter in the world we had five hundred plus members
and it was just i mean an absolute uh un- un- unforeseen thing that a woman should become president in this good ole boy city okay
[laughter]
[laughter]
don't misunderstand me now but it it all came down to the fact that you had to be able to deal i mean we had uh our board our officers and our b- board of directors of about twenty people now this is a good size group of people to manage
and to come to one voice on on certain things you understand
and in my year we did perfectly fine and the the gentlemen that came behind me was a uh wonderful intelligent smooth really good looking successful young black man
but he had his own agenda and he wouldn't compromise with people he thought that because he was president he could drive through whatever he chose
um-hum
and it was a terrible a terrible situation
i mean the whole thing almost fell apart
[laughter]
and i think what you have to do i mean y- i think it's important that you have an agenda but you also have to be able to to compromise on it because if the majority are against you
and you lose more than two or three times you know you lose it it been a a terrible situation for you and for your reputation
sure
and i think what happens is in order to get anything passed in the big political system in washington you have to you know compromise with other people and vote for something maybe you don't really believe in
but so that they will vote for something that you're asking for
yeah that's that kind of um you know i in a in it's gotten very pervasive
when it comes to expectations on the part of members of each of the party that you try not to cross party lines on certain votes especially these days
and the problem comes about when you have somebody who wants to vote for something the other party advocates strongly and
and they really want to vote for it [laughter]
yeah well in some cases they do they vote their conscience and then of course you know they may be punished for not doing the appropriate thing that that came down with the cable issue
yeah uh-huh
because we had a republican senator uh john danforth who is strongly in support of it but then you had the white house strongly against it because it would reregulate to an extent
yes it would
and they just wouldn't hear of it at all so we had trouble but he stood his ground
and carried with him a lot of in- you know people underneath him who are republicans but at the same point it causes a lot of strife and then people dig their heels in and
and you know there's probably about ten percent or maybe less than that five percent of the people who can vote their own conscience and still be successful but all the rest fall by the wayside
um-hum
yeah you have to be a real old timer and powerful to be able to do that especially when it's committee assignment handout time and
right right i am
things like that
[noise] -pinion on whether we need to change to the metric system is that i don't think that i have an opinion one way or the other
[noise]
[laughter]
i kind of feel that there are more important issues to be dealt with than worrying about the metric system and i think the reason it failed last time is that most people really just didn't see any real benefit in changing
so i guess if we were to go about making the change
you would have to really demonstrate to people that there is some legitimate reason to make the change that would directly benefit them otherwise we're never going to really see any change
yeah well
i oh i'll say this first i'm certainly for conversion to the metric system unfortunately i'm not sure how well grounded my uh feelings for that are maybe it's
um-hum
just because it's a highly regular system and you don't have to worry about whether something is five thousand two hundred and eighty units or or
yeah
i'm just going to walk over here and stop my cats from doing what they're doing um and the metric system is you know
hum
you it has so many different prefixes like autometer and femtometer and stuff like that you don't need them just use the you know the meter the kilometer you know whatever it's i don't know that that's i think that's its primary uh
yeah
primary uh use is that
and of course in scientific uses uh things like the like a mile uh or i'm not s- a pound uh have have some use whenever you try to uh combine them into formula then you have to
uh have conversion constants and things like that so most most of the formulas although they are are some that uh don't obey this rule
most scientific formulas can be adapted with the metric system because of the way things are interrelated that you'll need those extra conversion constants
yeah
like a cubic let's see what is it a cubic centimeter of water is also a gram of water at standard temperature and pressure
um-hum
well whenever the canadians changed we're since we're very close to the canadian border here we kind of observed things when they made their change
and they were able to convert a little more readily although most people up there still would talk in terms of fahrenheit instead of celsius
um-hum
uh even though they try to get you to use the celsius system it it went a little easier because canada is so influenced by britain
right
and a lot of the products and services that they were either dealing with or receiving on their end were really equipped for the metric system
and uh it was a easier change and they saw some direct benefit because they didn't have to pour the extra income in to making special products just for the [noise] older system
right
but um you know in in this country you have really stubborn people [laughter]
yeah that's true
who i don't think are going to especially you know they may do it in the more in the big city centers or in certain round uh manufacturing industries
but the average person in raleigh missouri i don't think is going to what was this celsius stuff you know i don't
[laughter]
well it it happens first well it i guess it happens first in either of the two places i guess either in the school or just products
hum
uh one thing about uh a lot of u._s. products i'm just looking at something here shaving cream that is not in this case
uh list both what they are in the english or british imperial system whatever it's called units uh and the metric system units so this just says seven ounces
um-hum
uh i- i think i've heard that in canada what they did was primarily they didn't change the size the sizes that various products came in they just changed the way they were annotated
yeah
so something before was you know w- and see you have things in odd measurements that's even true like for film and like you know sixteen millimeter and thirty five millimeter film
um-hum
those odd things come about i'm not sure exactly what they are because it's like a half inch or whatever they just
you know they say okay milli- this is a european thing too
so uh we'll just used to keep using the standard size but we'll just call it something else so you have odd things like sixteen millimeter and thirty five millimeter where originated in the metric system it'll probably be something regular but i guess that's that's not too [noise]
yeah
not too important but i think uh at least in northern or northeastern schools uh they people are relatively uh well inducted into the metric system
[noise]
anyone who takes you know chemistry physics anything like that in school i think in most cases it's done in in metric system it was for me
yeah i
i learned metrics you know in high school and and before that so i'm familiar with the system i'm still using inches and pounds and the like
i the only thing we as americans have become accustomed to as far as the metric system is now we buy two liter bottles of coke you know [laughter]
yeah when you tell somebody liters bottles of coke yeah
[laughter]
that's true that is and oddity
i mean it sounds you know a gallon sounds like that's too much but two liters and and you know doesn't sound as bad as three quarts or [laughter]
[noise] happen to know what the laws are in texas
[noise]
uh capital punishment is uh you know acc- an accepted punishment it it's legal
uh-huh
uh there are uh there have been a number of executions
over the last few years
hum
uh [noise]
they drag you know the the appeals drag on interminably it seems sometimes
um personally i kept i keep thinking that if i could be guaranteed that
the people who perpetrate some of these vicious crimes were never allowed free then i would not be in favor of capital punishment
but wh-
oh i see what you're saying
but uh when i know that
uh they could be paroled and go right back to doing what they did before i i feel decidedly un- uneasy about it
huh [noise]
what about new york
well in new yo- i'm not quite sure but what sounds familiar to me is that [noise] i- it's not legal except in cases of murder of police officers
uh-huh okay
i might be mistaken but that's what sounds familiar to me
um-hum
so uh so we don't hear about it
we-
yeah
i was visiting in california recently and apparently they over about two weeks ago they just executed one fellow
um-hum
it is legal there but th- they always put it off and put it off and they finally for the first time in twenty five years executed someone
yes
um-hum
yes
so that was quite the news
i remember reading about that
um
is it only usually in cases of murder sort of an eye for an eye kind of thing
it's uh it's more than that i think it's a capital murder uh where
uh there there was an intent to do other harm as well you know where you you engaged in another felony like robbery a- at the same time that you murdered someone
okay i know there's a a s- subtle difference between manslaughter and murder
yes
i guess you can commit manslaughter by running somebody over by accident that kind of thing
by accident
yes
uh-huh
that's my understanding of it uh but that uh murder is something that you do intentionally
uh-huh
uh [vocalized-noise]
i don't know it just seems to me that
everybody wants to know if they do something what's going to happen to them
um-hum
i substitute teach and i have kids who talk fresh don't do homework and they say so what's going to happen to me and
and people getting less and less respect and they un- they know that the bottom line is not very much is going to happen to them
um-hum
so if i could be sure that the people who are sentenced to execution absolutely did it because you know during the with the jury system you're not quite sure
um-hum
no you're not
you know i i- i'd feel comfortable with it if i knew absolutely certainly that this person actually murdered someone
[noise]
um-hum
um-hum
or
but i- i think the reason we don't go for it is because we're afraid that we might be making a mistake and you can't fix it
[vocalized-noise] that's right and and it's a terrible thing to do uh
[vocalized-noise] and the world our world seems to become more and more violent all the time by the way i'm a public school administrator [laughter] so [laughter]
okay
well did you do you find that the kids are changing and they they don't they they don't respect authority anymore
oh
at all
they they do not respect authority uh they kill for fun
i
uh
they shoot guns for amusement after parties um
hum well the guns are legal where you are it's quite a to do to get a gun around here legally that is
yes
well i- it's not it's not legal to carry a handgun in texas but no it's not you can have it in your home
oh i didn't know that
okay
or in your car if you're traveling
from one city to another
oh okay that clears th-
but uh rifles shotguns those sorts of guns are legal
um-hum well they can do just as much damage
oh yes it's just that they're harder to hide
[laughter]
that's true [laughter]
but i do [laughter] i feel decidedly uneasy about the judicial system in our country now not only because we can't be sure that the jury
you know has made the right decision that the person who did it's really guilty or really isn't guilty
and yet i feel very uncomfortable about the numbers of people who are paroled put back on the streets and within a few months are raping and killing other people
[noise]
[noise]
and you say you have some strong feelings about uh the issue
uh yes i do as far as uh
as far as uh
as far as immigration as a whole goes
uh-huh
i think that uh we simply must start
accepting everybody in the world
uh-huh
uh i there just is not gonna be room for all of us we don't have jobs now
i i think uh i think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time
um [noise] hope you're one of the employed right now
uh-huh
i am one of the unemployed right now
i was a systems analyst and programmer for an oil company
and uh
i applied for one set of jobs with a company here in dallas that they had two hundred openings but they had two thousand applications
oh
and i know that there are a lot of foreigners uh here y- you know doing my line of work
uh-huh
and of course i'm not perfectly happy about not having a job
right
so how do you feel
well i'm a little bit ambivalent the problem with uh
and i think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it uh in
in terms of what uh really is driving it they're not willing to tell the truth the same way with um uh issues of uh race and things like that
[noise] i mean right now
um i believe there are two policies that uh that the government uses to modulate immigration three actually
one is at the high end uh they always wanna be able to um do some brain draining
they'd always like to be able to attract the uh einsteins or the professor chou or you know they'd like to be able to get the top people in any field and so they can almost always find room for someone like that
right
at the bottom end
they um
are always willing to um let in cheap labor [noise] if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area
those are two [noise] things that i think are going on although they i- i i don't think the politicians would tell you that
okay and i think you're right in both cases
and then the third thing [noise] is uh the political aspect of uh uh letting steam come out from under the lid in mexico
[noise]
they cannot close off the mexican border not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in mexico would be uh
uh would spill over to this country so they keep allowing um the pressure cooker to um
let off steam
and i think probably it's pretty important right there how do you feel about haitian immigration
uh [noise] that's one of the few things i guess i found myself in agreement with pat buchanan
[noise]
i think they're very difficult group to integrate into uh society they're very difficult um group to find jobs and uh and uh places for
and so um um i don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem that uh in that they're pretty miserable where they are
but i'm not to sympathetic about um
letting large numbers of haitians in
actually
actually i feel [noise] that if we accepted these people
that we would eventually have almost the total population here
yeah
and it would have nothing to do with political situations it would have to do with poverty
right
but if you let them yeah if you let them in a million at a time it wouldn't make that you know it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population but po- politically and economically
oh my gosh have you been to have you been to southern florida
yeah well i know about it uh i mean it's it is now with haitians the way it was with cubans uh twenty years ago
well i mean and the two of them together i mean we can it's just as well [laughter] you know it's hardly america anymore
on the other hand you know i- the ironic thing about this is that there's
nobody more full of the entrepreneurial american spirit than a first generation immigrant [laughter]
so there's uh uh there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in
but there's some differences in the immigrants
that that we're getting now well in i particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration
right
sure
i think probably y- your a great deal of what you say is true about the legals
right
but uh the majority of the illegal immigration we're getting now they do not come here to blend into america
uh they they don't bother to learn our language
and uh [noise] first of all th- they've i'm sorry this i really feel strongly about this we send a lot of money to mexico
um-hum
um-hum
uh i- i hope i don't consider them a uh threat because uh [laughter] uh we sure have taken down a lot of security measures that that we once had um i don't know seems u- um
maybe a little bit young to remember the uh i'm on- i'm i'm twenty two so i don't think i remember the uh
uh
you know the height of the cold war and and whatnot but i
huh-uh
i don't know i don't consider the soviet union a threat in that uh by any means just because of the fact that there's not uh uh anything that they have to threaten us with anymore
well there not i mean there really is no soviet union now unfortunately they still do have a lot of uh nuclear weapons
exactly th- that's true that's
uh-huh
and uh the one thing that worries me is is question of stability and control
um-hum
and uh i think it's too early to say you know whether they're going to develop some stable societies there in one form or another
um-hum
or whether this uh [vocalized-noise] old uh russian tendency to
turn their fate over to some insane ruler is going to surface again
sure yeah
[vocalized-noise]
they didn't they didn't have a very good track record even before the revolution [laughter]
no they really didn't uh now you know they never really have had democracy there in any sense so
[laughter]
no no
um
it's going to take both democracy and economic progress and uh resolution of their nationalist institutes i guess
right
all of that is going to have to happen and if any one of them turn sour they could still be uh dangerous simply because they might not
you know they just might sort of lose track of what they're doing
right
um i- i guess [vocalized-noise]
i'm not so concerned about an organized danger uh
maybe for the maybe for the simple reason that um
despite the fact that they do have uh [vocalized-noise] you know probably a large uh substantial nuclear capability
uh i'm not sure that that all of that capability is organized anymore i mean you know just along with it with the dissolution the that the of the uh
soviet union i think that [vocalized-noise] a lot happened with the dissolution of their of their military power
but that's really part of the danger because they still have uh you know i think there still uh missile uh bases or silos in uh
um-hum
in uh kazakhstan probably in ukraine
right right
as well as in russia uh those in russia may be some of them in areas that uh may have uh
right
strong local national sentiments because they aren't all russians you know they're a lot of enclaves they have other nationalities
yeah sure
uh-huh
and if even one uh
missile silo got in the hands of someone who is uh determined to
cause trouble for some for some reason they might launch a missile on someone
i think i see your point uh you have you have uh where once you had uh one government controlling a a a large number of missiles now you have several
smaller governments uh highly volatile
governments and militaries and it's not always clear which one of them is in charge
militaries yeah sure
well that's maybe the uh the uh extreme pessimistic view
um-hum
um think if uh yeltsin has a chance and if they can follow his lead in the other republics or whatever they want to call themselves now
yeah
um they'll probably come out of it okay
um-hum
uh do you see
uh i have not perceived and i wonder if you've perceived any uh uh antiamericanism uh sentiments uh [vocalized-noise] on any level like you know that that we receive from the from the middle east for example
what in the former soviet union
yeah
um not much i don't think i think that uh
probably or uh or uh image there is pretty good most places as i understand it
right
um-hum
do you worry that we might uh overs- [vocalized-noise] i guess my question is do you do you think that there are ways that we might over- overstep our bounds and provoke uh
provoke anger in the soviet union and and what would those what would those steps be
provoke a threat
what might make them angry at us may make the people angry at us or the governments or both or
um-hum
you know both i guess
well
i think if they uh
thought that we were taking advantage of their uh current preoccupations with internal matters or with
um-hum
[noise] okay [noise] uh i just currently
[noise]
quit my job and so
[laughter]
i really don't receive any benefits right now [laughter]
[laughter] right
[laughter]
but my husband does and um
i think one of the um my first of all always salary and second the second thing is um because we have children so it'd be um
health benefits and medical benefits and and um right now we have
yeah yeah definitely
probably some excellent benefits right now we have with aetna and uh i don't know if you're familiar with them but we're real happy with them
yeah yes i've had a variety of different jobs with of various types um in the computer field and so seen a variety of different types of benefits um i've worked for for [vocalized-noise] for awhile and
they are you know really um an academic type of place and then i've worked with regular you know industry type places and then with others that are kind of half way between and stuff so i've seen a wide range of
both you know nonsalary type benefits and other stuff you know like health care that's either fully or partially paid and
you know some have like bonuses and others have had lots of vacation time but not much o- other types of benefits and
um-hum
so yeah i would i'd say health care is way up there especially for anybody with kids um
yeah
and that's one of the big things that we always look at you know when we when i think about tak- changing jobs is you know
you know what kind of health care they have and does the company pay for it you know all or partially or how does that work
um-hum
and um also um vacation time too is a is a big one for me
yeah yeah
um and i guess support for whatever whatever other you know kinds of professional activities you have at you know work
yeah
um because i've been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any
hm
right
and some that sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though so that's not so bad um you know it's kind of a give and take kind of thing i think
right
yeah
um-hum
um i say that uh health care is probably definitely number one though uh you can wind up just l- you know l- all your salary can't can't even begin to pay for what you can wind up losing you know with a major illness or something
yeah
yeah
um
right
um and and and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices [laughter]
and who to go with
yeah
and that really helped us out a great deal
so
but my husband does get vacation and it's worked out really good for us too
uh-huh
so [noise] but
ye-
yeah flexible hours are are pretty important to me as well um because that makes a big difference my wife works part time
yeah
um-hum
and she works um as a assistant manager in a fabric store and so she works a lot of evenings and weekends
uh-huh
and so two days a week i um manage to get home early enough to meet the kids from the bus [noise] because she wor- you know goes in early those days and works like you know noon till close
um so we have [vocalized-noise] [noise]
well that's great that y'all can work that out that's really good
yeah and being on a you know rigid schedule wouldn't there wouldn't be anyway to do that at all
right
and i think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too because i mean usually you know you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting up for school and you get home and it's already dark unless it's summer time you know and even if it's summer sometimes you get home so late that there's you know you can't do anything with them
um-hum
yeah
and especially in the winter i mean you ge- get up in the dark and come home in the dark you know it's like it's like a vampire sometimes
yeah
[laughter]
yeah it's that same with my husband because he's got pretty flexible hours if
as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do with that's
worked out really well for us too
yeah
um
well is there anything else that you look for or
um a lot of it to i guess is
you hit pretty you put a lot of the main points in
yeah i think some it is how the uh
you know i guess it's not really a direct benefit but how you um performance is rated and stuff like that at work
um-hum
because i've been uh especially in large corporations you can really you know wind up getting
having you know real problems i've found out i've worked for a few you know several thousand plus [noise] you know type companies
yeah
and it especially if you're doing like professional work where th- you know it's kind of
[noise] ethereal as to what you're doing you know if you're like i've i work with uh computer systems a lot
yeah
so it's kind of hard to say you know if you're a you know brick layer somebody can
look and see you know well yeah you laid you know fifteen thousand bricks today and they were all straight and your building didn't fall down [noise] you know yeah you did a great job
if you build computer systems like well you know what does that computer program really do you know or if especially if you write like papers you know or do design studies or something it's real hard to rate something like that
um-hum
um-hum
it's like being a painter or you know or something an artist it's like well jeez how do you really rate you know michelangelo you know [noise] how would you tell if he was you know really good or [noise] so-so or whatever
yeah
no
yeah
and that does make wan- a person want to stay
[noise] uh around here we have a program where uh we we put out the the we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff
[noise]
from the newspapers and we keep the newspapers in a in a their collected twice a month
and the trash and th- this bottled [vocalized-noise] stuff uh that uh is put in a in a little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck so they may a- actually have about three passes at this collection
that sounds
one for the regular trash one for the uh um you know bottles and cans and one for the newspapers
but i gather you do not separate uh the bottles and cans
no they they do that on the truck they separate them as they as they you know dump them and you know one guy comes around with his truck and and dumps it all in there
uh-huh
and uh i think they're they're running out of uh you know [vocalized-noise] the sanitary landfill i think uh is you know running out of course um you being from new mexico you've probably been i- to washington especially if your your present location
yes
you must have come to washington at least once
yes i know not only have i come to washington but um i find it very amusing that uh the
thing that was just instituted here is very similar that is we also have blue bins we also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck
and uh land fill space is indeed the driving factor here and in fact uh despite all of our open space out here land fill space is still um very hard to come by
my you've got a lot a lot of nothing out there
uh
you know they got i mean there there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you can you could use for landfill now [vocalized-noise] [noise]
ah but if somebody can make a regulation about it they will
well what other uh well [vocalized-noise] what uh what unique things you think uh that you can do about it in in what at los alamos uh [noise] o- other than nuking it
[noise] well um
yes other than nuking it um in fact los alamos uh has uh done a fair amount of research uh in recycling things in general
[laughter]
um it it involves for instance um creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium and barium and uh other things from
uh waste material in general and um and purify the waste of specific uh uh nasty elements
well isn't that uh that's uh that's pretty uh upscale uh trash uh uh situation i don't think anybody around here would understand all the all those exotic techniques you know getting rid of the heavy metals
[vocalized-noise]
and the other thing that just was in the local news bulletin was somebody has uh
[vocalized-noise] made some special um polymers that have the ability to uh make certain actinide elements adhere to them um
uh they've uh looked at uh plutonium and uranium and uh some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste
hum
and again this is driven by all of the documentation and uh e. s. and h. uh uh considerations that uh people are uh worrying about i think much more than they should
[vocalized-noise]
actually i've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable back when i was in graduate school i did all of the recycling of the um paper from the computer center
and uh in fact i think i was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recyclable pa- recycled paper
hum
[laughter]
well that certainly uh you know uh getting into the swim of things
i- i think it should be i- it should go to the to the heart of the matter though and say okay guy y- y- everybody gets you know five pounds of garbage that they can throw away you know uh but more than that every week uh you've got to pay by the pound
i think that's a wonderful idea
i- i- i- i think i think people would be would get very very you know they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff
[noise] the only alternative i would see is uh and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain
uh if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would uh speak more directly to the space need than the land fill
um-hum
yeah
and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more uh and uh and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight
um-hum
well of course that uh you know those big trucks can can probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor
[noise]
[noise]
it looks like um
we're going to have um a um
sort of a third party movement on our hands in the fall
yeah
and uh
i guess the last time that happen was uh
well i guess it was anderson in seventy two and then there was wallace in sixty
anderson
eighty or whenever it was
yeah i remember remember anderson but also a little a little young for that one
[noise]
i guess the
what i see behind it this this this uh maybe it's always true of third party movements but this one seems to be almost entirely negative
almost completely a reaction to uh um
uh failure of the other two parties rather than anything positive that's uh represented
yeah i [vocalized-noise] that's a pretty good point i hadn't thought about it like that but yeah it's i guess it's not really um a start up with uh
necessarily new ideas and you know this is my positive outlook but rather uh saying well uh i'm just not very happy with uh with the other two parties seem to be going type of thing
yeah i think there's absolutely no political philosophy the only thing that uh perot um seems to has to offer is that uh he's a doer
yeah
[noise]
and since most people agree on what needs to be done but nobody can figure out how to do it he's just going to say uh
i'm a c._e._o. i know how to tell people to do things and get them done
yeah
which is uh pretty attractive and when uh congress can't seem to be able to get anything done
yeah i guess read a political cartoon uh must be probably about a week ago now or maybe you saw it i don't know how widespread this was but it showed uh perot like revealing his
you know what he stood for or whatever it's kind of like he had showed him open up his overcoat and [vocalized-noise] open he open they drawed him um they drew him [laughter] opening up his overcoat and inside was another overcoat
uh-huh
[laughter]
so it's like you know his he hasn't really he hasn't really said very much of what he stands for or what you know he's kind of pretty much [vocalized-noise] vowed to saying you know i'll get i'll get this done and get that done you know but what is this and that type of thing
[noise]
yeah
but
well i think um
it's it's a reaction to what's what's happened over the last ten or fifteen years where um the parties really just seem to be intent on blocking the other party from getting any further the the uh
yeah
the democrats want to get the republicans out of the white house and republicans want to try to get control of congress but they don't seem to have any really big ideas or sweeping um vision of where things should go
yeah
and now things are are so stalled
that uh
out of uh pure frustration comes along with uh
uh a guy who says he can get things done
yeah
so maybe he is part of a um a more general
trend in politics over the last twenty years
[noise]
the um
uh
i don't know those of us who weren't too happy with the reagan years saw that as a
as just a um [vocalized-noise] of selfishness and um
yeah
government just got out of the way there wasn't no prevailing philosophy except do what you can to get you something for yourself
yeah it it it seems it seems as though that that's definitely definitely a point of the two parties pretty much trying to block each other and there's been a definite i'd say definite loss in actual
you know ideals and there's just there's too much each side you know where there's republican or democrat both of them like trying to
um
you know either play to the hands of like what the dominant philosophy is uh not not not not dominant but like old style philosophy of each each
um
in each party and not really coming up with a new ideas or the or maybe i mean it it you know it's time for maybe a definite new vision and and what's going on which may be you know a blend of both
you know maybe both parties or you know a little bit of this a little bit of that which may not fall into the lines of either party but you know just doesn't seem as though either party wants to do very much that rocks the boat or maybe maybe says oh its time for a little bit of you know
um
yeah
things aren't going very well oh in the big picture maybe right now congress getting better or it's maybe it's getting worse or who knows but you know it's just like a little ripple in the ocean it's [vocalized-noise] know some some somebody got to look down the road a ways and say well what's going to go on
yeah
what
yeah what i see is all tactics and no strategy um that and uh
yeah
yeah
it's i mean it's fun to watch on a day by day basis but it doesn't get anything done in the long run
right right
[noise]
if all you're interested in is making the other guy look bad and making yourself look good you don't really accomplish anything
right
yeah
in the long run the infrastructure deteriorates and people kind of lose their uh sense of a of purpose
yeah
yeah i take that definitely
[noise] yeah do you have a particular opinion on it
[noise]
i'm a little uh i'm a
not i i think that
that i do i i'm not sure that uh
[noise]
that i think it should be like a normal practice all the time i think there are certain circumstances where it's important but it it kind of touches on on on privacy
[noise]
and so you know i i have kind of a a feeling that that it's a little invasive [noise]
[noise]
[noise] but then again on the other hand you have to stop and realize that um a lot of people are are uh are are trapped in that
in that addiction thing you know and it's bad for them but
that's not necessarily gonna mean that they're gonna get the help they need and and get cured or anything you know [noise]
and some jobs uh uh require you to be
straight and with it to do a good job and protect yourself and
and things like that too you know so how you think how you feel
well well i'm kind of ambivalent also y- like you say it it does affect your privacy um i guess i
how i could cope with it i do think in some cases it does make sense and how i could cope with it was um if when you accepted a job they told you up front this is part of it
[noise] you know then it's like porn movie you have the choice you know nobody sticks it in your face you've got the choice if you don't wanna deal with it don't take the job
right
[vocalized-noise]
there you go that's right
um there are certain jobs in which i'd be more likely to feel comfortable about it and and those are the jobs in which a person's performance could affect your life
um-hum
certainly uh someone who carries a gun
um-hum
um there's been a lot of publicity um in new york on long island where um
there's been school bus drivers
who have driven erratically and caused accidents and killed kids because they were
wow
uh on drugs and things
yeah
and where your actions could affect somebody's life i'd be much more accepting of drug testing but under no circumstances would i think that you could just go take a job and they could say hey guess what you know we're gonna do this
right
i- i think it has to be up front and then you've got the choice of not doing it
yeah well well the problem there is that you know a lot of people that have worked for the same company for so long um that company decides well if we're going to hire new people you know
well we're going to have to start checking it because we've had a problem in the past
well their problem in the past is with past employees and so the new people are saying well [noise]
if you know [vocalized-noise] i- i am sure this could happen you know if you're gonna if you're gonna um test us you should be testing the old people too and so they get into a to a discrimination problem probably or something like that
well yeah i imagine it would be just this is new company policy and we're doing it to everybody
yeah
in which case hey you know you don't like it you can go look for another job but of course that's not so easy you know um
s- there's one of the big problems people are are in that situation they need that job
right
um and uh
then they have the choice of either take the test or don't get the or or don't take the job and if they know they're going to fail the test you know [noise]
[laughter] they're kind of in a in a between a rock and a hard place there so it's uh kind of like [vocalized-noise]
[vocalized-noise] i took a i'm i'm a licensed art teacher and i substitute which is why i'm home today i'm not wor- i'm not working
oh really
lucky you
well you know i'm home a little too often i think they're they're not calling substitutes that often but at any rate um i had taken a state test to be of all things a court officer
uh-huh
uh my mom had worked for the state and she thought this was a brilliant idea so i just went along with it i thought it'd be neat you know like a james bond woman with a gun and all this and part of the um you know you take this test i did very well and they called me in for a physical
and part of it was a test for drugs nobody asked me you know they didn't mention what they were doing but it was perfectly obvious and i you know all government people and all army people are just tested
right
and there was one fellow who just kept horsing around he he seemed almost
you know a little crazy
but he wouldn't you know give a urine sample and it was pretty obvious why you know he's just like oh i can't do it i can't do it you know [laughter] and this went on for hours i was wondering why he didn't just leave you know if you're not going to do it just leave
he was gonna fail [laughter]
right because you're not gonna get the job if you don't
it was it was almost comical
um in my case they didn't follow me in the bathroom but apparently they were following you know the more suspicious types into the bathroom
yeah
you know because apparently people i- i read somewhere that you can replace your urine with gin- with warm sprite or something mountain dew and it tests you know that it tests like urine and you know it tests okay obviously
huh
[noise]
i don't know
[noise] i've heard people using somebody elses
uh-huh yeah you know i mean i guess if there i guess there is something to be worried about if there's a whole science of knowing how to deal with the test
y- you know
smuggle it in
[noise] um
[noise] making a whole new element of society out there
yeah [vocalized-noise]
[noise] i don't know you know um like i don't uh i don't use drugs you know but [noise] um
i know people who do i don't think
[noise] why don't you start this time
[noise]
[laughter] okay
uh let's see i have a macintosh 2ci and uh i'm a graduate student in cognitive psychology
uh and so i use it basically to run all my statistics and write up my reports and research and all that kind of good stuff
and i'd be dead without it [laughter]
yeah i'm in the same position i started on a commodore in nineteen eighty six um and moved up in eighty eight to an i._b._m. system and i'm running on an i._b._m. clone right now
under windows which basically is the same thing i think [laughter]
um-hum
[laughter]
and uh i've used it also i do tremendous amounts of word processing i work in radio but i'm required to do a lot of you know journalistic writing and that
hm
um-hum
uh so i do almost everything now in word or in some other you know word processing system and uh use it to gather news and information and put it all together for something that's usable
so i've had my computer i've i i've found what's happened is that i can't write anymore on paper you know
[laughter]
because i type so fast now that any it's distracting to try and write by hand because it takes too long
exactly exactly and then i like to like go back and re-edit things as soon as i write it and
and you know you can't do that very well with uh a piece of paper and a pencil you know cause it takes so much longer to change things around and and move whole chunks and all this that and the other
oh yeah
[noise]
[vocalized-noise] and of course you know i also run a bulletin board from here and i'm involved in fidonet
hm
oh okay
uh i'm the i'm the net coordinator up here for western and central new york
[laughter]
oh wow
uh part of net 260 here it's got we have eighty nodes in this city alone
wow
so we t- we try and get everybody together and that way it you know you can exchange mail between them and you don't have to call them
[laughter]
um-hum
right [laughter]
[laughter]
and i just got into the w- fidonet's now has a thing where we can get in with the internet so i found out
uh-huh yeah i've started seeing some uh internet postings from fidonet and stuff like that
yeah i it's where i found out about this through comp dcom telecom
yeah yeah
uh and i submit some messages on there i it's made things s- so much easier it's amazing though that
[vocalized-noise] in nineteen eighty six we were all doing like three hundred bawd
um-hum
and of course you know now that's like ancient history and you think my god it was only like five six years ago [laughter]
[laughter]
yep yep
[noise]
and then here's what we have now i mean what's in five years from now it's just unimaginable what we're going to be able to do with these things
[laughter]
yeah yeah well you know if we ever get any sort of uh i._s._d._n. running nationally it'll be really incredible
hm
if they have the amount of data we can exchange
well that's good gore's working on
right yeah well that and he's talking about expanding the the internet as it stands now upgrading the backbone stuff like that
yeah
uh so you know it's going to kind of impact everybody everywhere
well i see the phone companies are working on getting into information services so we're going to have a glut of things everyone i think we're going to see another revolution in
um-hum
computers but i think the reason why it didn't work the first time is that they assumed that everybody would need a computer to do all these things
uh when in fact at the time you know back in the early eighties uh and mid eighties you know people didn't the technology wasn't to the point where
it was something that could be easily learned for everyone but now we have the things like the mac and windows and other things where all you got to do is point at something and push a button
um-hum oh yeah
and i think that the technology's catching up to the point where we're going to be able to do things and make it a lot easier t- for people to understand how to do these things
um-hum
so i'm hoping that we will see another type of revolution but one that will be a little more friendly to the end user
yeah yeah um i think what's going to happen is it's going to sneak into the consumer market uh through the television and through the cable industry and telephone industry
um-hum
um i was just reading in the washington post this morning they've got an article in the business section uh about how at&t has just announced that they plan to offer uh cable t._v. systems with five hundred channels by nineteen ninety four
uh [laughter] you know
well they're working on that i'm a satellite dish owner and we've been fighting like mad to have these suckers re-regulated you know
[laughter]
because of the uh because they've stomped on us
yeah
and so now what's happening is the phone companies want to get into cable and introduce all these kinds of computer services over fiber optics
um-hum
and the cable industry now wants to get into the telephone industry through these personal communication things
right [laughter]
um-hum
but i think everyone's working now i i mean i'm seeing this we're going to see a lot more in the way of keyboards with electronic program guides and and everything else and ordering systems they have this thing called t._v. [vocalized-noise]
um-hum
[noise] an interesting topic
[noise]
yes the uh type of cars that i was uh uh i would probably be most interested in if i was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a uh mazda miata
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh the uh i'm very much uh a fan of sports cars
ah boy you and my husband would have a whole lot in common
the uh
yeah the um
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise] uh
though actually in so- actually if i ha- i have av- i've avoided buying a new car for quite some time
[noise] i'd rather put my money into restoring my old cars i have a old triumph t._r. six
uh-huh
and uh
[noise]
uh so uh but if i was to buy one probably something like a miata it's certainly i- i wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down all the time [laughter] yeah
oh really
what's the how old is your car
uh well i have a i have a nineteen eighty f- uh eighty five c._r._x.
oh [noise]
uh which is you know it's it still works fine [laughter] but it's [laughter] it's actually it's kind of annoying cause i've got no reason t- [laughter] to replace it but uh
yeah right
[laughter]
[laughter]
[noise] oh
yeah so what do the miatas run
[vocalized-noise]
[noise] oh those are they're about uh uh thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and you know a bit more if you add some some options and so on but [noise]
well that's not too bad
the uh yeah that's a pretty good price and they're they're they're they're s- so nice to drive uh
yeah
really i've never driven one
uh it's it's it's nice [laughter] they're uh i've been down to a dealer and driven them and i've also driven one at a something mazda put on where
uh they went to uh auto cross events across the country uh which is where you race in uh
you you race o- in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of uh cones to see who can get through them fastest
oh
uh yeah about a minute or so and uh very twisty stuff and oh it handles so nicely
uh-huh
and so you've done this oh okay oh
yeah
yeah it was just it it it's just so smooth and yeah nice car
really
[vocalized-noise]
what are you interested in
[laughter] whatever my husband buys [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter] you do- you [laughter] you don't get involved in uh car decisions
oh not too much no we um [noise]
we just got rid of a full conversion van that that i- i i- that wasn't me that was my husband he wanted the van and he wanted to drive that van and travel and wanted everything in there t. v. you know the whole bit
[laughter]
[laughter]
but i never drove it so it just it wasn't me you know
[noise]
yeah i can understand well would you want if you had to decide what would you want
and then
oh i'd want a minivan [laughter] because i'm with the kids all the time yeah yeah and
okay yeah they're nice
oh yeah that's perfect for that
it's not it it's small enough that it's easy to drive
yeah you pick u- i pick up my little one from preschool and the whole parking lot's full of minivans but you know i- i drive a little subaru
holds a lot
yeah
yeah [vocalized-noise]
[noise] and uh w- i love that uh we were going to trade that in for the van but i just wanted to hold on to that because i just really enjoy that
right
and um that's really all i needed was for something just to go here and there and back
yeah uh minivans are nice i have a friend who has a minivan and uh i've driven it a few times and uh it's nice it's nice of course
uh-huh
you know my fam- my family has always had cars like that uh in that yeah my father has had a had a always had a v._w. bus every since uh ninet- about nineteen sixty or so
oh really
oh really
uh i
[laughter]
they [vocalized-noise] he he uses [noise] he often has to transport plants or uh things like that cause he's he goes to orchid shows and and you know f- fills the car with plants and so on or [vocalized-noise]
yeah
yeah it's amazing what a minivan can do we went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan and pulled uh um the little trailer behind the pop up trailer and uh it's so it's really amazing how much a minivan c- c- you know what it can do
[noise]
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah and they're not that expensive
no they're not
[vocalized-noise] yeah
they probably we probably
mainly because everyone makes them you know you can take your choice of how expensive you want it to be
yeah
yeah and we we do a lot of um driving we do a lot of traveling by car and so that's the only time that the that the uh conversion van came in handy but it really didn't cause our our kids are still little
hum
um-hum
so um [noise] that was the only time we really needed it other than that it got terrible mileage and
yeah
yeah minivans d- do pretty well
yeah
you know twenty twenty twenty five miles per gallon or more
yeah
some of them probably even do thirty
yeah
the uh
yeah there there's some other cars i'd like but i uh uh i would never be willing to spend quite that much money for uh like uh uh i'll drool over them
[noise]
[noise] i don't really know any elderly uh
in uh
[noise] no i hello
homes or anything
[noise]
care of the elderly i guess is
yeah i haven't given much thought to it i'm kind of busy raising my kids
the only way i can relate to it is i think of my mother taking care of her parents
[noise]
yeah
and i remember her running over there every morning to make sure they got
dressed and an- and [noise] fed and cleaned
[noise]
and uh i remember her saying to me i hope don't ever let me do that to you put me in a home because it's it's hellish on the person who has to give the care to a person like that
[laughter]
you know these
they have uh around here they've got these uh they're like uh condos
um-hum
uh complexes and they're uh
oh for senior citizens
geared to [vocalized-noise] elderly and senior citizens
and they have i think uh like a nurse on staff there
we- i don't think yeah i don't think the problem is i mean those condos are like elderly people just living in their own apartments i think the trouble begins when they have more physical problems
and they take care of some of that kind of thing
um-hum
i mean it's got to be humiliating to have a stranger a nurse or somebody lift you in and out of a bathtub
[laughter] yeah
you know because i mean i'm i'm not aged but i'm i'm forty one now and i still feel twenty something and i realize that my body is kind of traitorous and and and changing on me even though i'm not feeling terribly old
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
so i can imagine you [vocalized-noise] you know being eighty and somebody has to dress you and you're probably sitting there thinking my god this is so degrading but your body just won't do it
[laughter]
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
well i don't know i don-
i'm not sure that uh
this is necessarily true du- even if they're eighty you know because you can
a lot of people uh maintain their
their uh fitness and so forth right on
up
well i- i think nowadays people are making that effort to eat right and to be more fit and i think old age is getting older
yeah that's a definitely uh that's statistically true
hum are your parents alive
and
my dad's eighty five i think right now eighty five
do [vocalized-noise] and he fends totally for himself
yep
that's wonderful
he still [laughter] yeah he was having a little trouble getting his driver's license he lives down in florida
[laughter]
where i was raised but uh [laughter]
that's great [vocalized-noise] that looks good for you too you know [laughter] longevity in the family
yeah
right yeah and my grandmother was
lived to a pretty ripe old age too
of course she was in a home when she lo- you know her
her mind went
my dad's is
still pretty you know pretty well with it
well i you know [vocalized-noise] my thought is if your mind goes at the same rate your body goes then nobody cares right you know it's like animals when they're stupid what the hell do they know [laughter] i think if one goes before the other is when you run into trouble
[laughter]
yeah right i guess
yeah well that like that uh
what is it uh [noise]
that disease of the
alzheimer's
yeah
oh that'd be awful
well i- i think it that kind of thing is probably awful for everybody around you i think these people don't rightly know what they're doing
yeah yeah really
yeah it's hard to say
yeah that's true
i had a friend that got that and he was fairly young i think he was in his
like late thirties or forties or something like that
we- is that something that is that something that affects you all the time or do you kind of like wave in and wave out of it
uh maybe a little lower
[vocalized-noise] i don't know
i think it does come and go to some extent but it just keeps continually getting worse
yeah
um that doesn't doesn't sound too pleasant
no it isn't [laughter]
well
well i you know i
talking about [vocalized-noise] what would you look for if you had to put someone in a home i guess
uh
i don't know i guess a place that has the most activities you know keeping your mind alive even if you couldn't do very much
um-hum
you'd have to go uh
i guess you'd have to go kind try and
pay them surprise visits and see if you could tell what the
atmosphere was like and so forth
yeah that's that's true
if they were uh you know seemed to be
caring or whether they were just [noise] warehousing them [laughter]
yeah [noise]
there's a lot of them like that i'm afraid
well you know you nobody takes care of your own as well as you would i was brought up in in a city where everybody lived in apartment buildings and there wasn't any room to you know wasn't houses [vocalized-noise] there wasn't a room to take in the elderly
um-hum
yeah
so if and when they couldn't take care of themselves they couldn't move in with you because you had a three room apartment or something so you know that's why they went somewhere else
[laughter]
where in the city
uh you know
my life's changed now i o-
[noise] i kind of think the probably the biggest political topic that i can think of at this point
[noise]
is probably the ross perot uh candidacy uh i think that that has some interesting uh effects to it at this point with the uh
um-hum
level of um
uh ou- outrage that the public seems to have the voting public seems to have with the existing candidates out there and i think that uh
that is certainly something that we haven't seen to this level before
right well they've been independent candidates before but uh never
as a- as popular as he seems to be and i mean it seems to be um doesn't really matter who who it is it's just that fact that he's not in either party
that uh seems to be why he's so popular i guess
[noise] what's your view on
big political issues
hm
um
well if we i- i- i mean sticking with this topic um
i would just say that you know it's it's interesting that it doesn't really seem to matter what um what his views are you know i mean he seems to have some views which are pretty conservative and which are pretty liberal
um-hum
um
but i- it seems like people are more interested in just the fact that he's an alternative you know than to um
to what what you know i- i- i guess he hasn't really outlined a platform yet you know and people keep asking him you know what what do you feel uh is the b- a plan to deal with the budget or blah blah blah
yeah
and um he really doesn't have any answers i guess but that doesn't stop his popularity from swelling you know people are just sick and tired of um everyone else i guess
it seems to be i don't know it's kind of like um people always
people always blame you know they always say how can [noise] uh-oh [laughter] dogs outside um
[laughter]
people always [vocalized-noise] say how how can these politicians be in power and stuff but i guess they forget that they're the ones who put them there in the first place you know
they're always they're always trying to find third third alternatives like um
you know uh limiting limiting number of years in office for instance
but you know all they have to do is vote him out of office you know it's almost like they want to be forced to vote the way that they
could in any case you know what i mean [laughter]
yeah
it seems strange
[noise] it- it's going to be interesting to see if he uh actually you know we hear the complaints about uh voter apathy and and the whole the whole shebang about throw the bums out
right
it and i- it usually you know it's a big deal until election day comes around and then it you know it fizzles out and we end up with the same people
exactly
and uh you have to wonder whether is this going to be something that uh is really going to result in
hm
um a mass turnout of the current people that we have in there or whether this is just going to be another of the same old well throw the bums out but not my bum you know [laughter]
right right as long as he brings pork back [laughter] my state then um w- what do you think his
chances are what do you think uh how much of the vote do you think he's going to get and do you think he will take it more from the republicans or the democrats
well the m- media keeps saying that he's supposed to drain it away from the democrats but i know that there's a lot of democrats that don't like bill clinton
um-hum um-hum uh-huh
i'm one of them i'm not happy with bill clinton at all uh but
i you know i'm c- more concerned about democrats saying they're unhappy with bill clinton and then they go and vote for ross perot and then we basically split any protest vote
ag- against bush more or less in half you know i mean you're dividing it too far and then he squeaks by for four more years and you know for me that's not a going to be a wonderful uh feeling
exac-
right
exactly
but uh
i think it'll be interesting to see um whether it turns out he gets more than twenty percent of the vote if that um i
um-hum
personally i have a i have a problem with
with electing someone who's that rich [laughter] um i mean they're all that rich anyway but but someone who's advertised as that rich i don't know i i- i kind of
um have problems seeing what he and i would have in common you know
yeah but i you know it'll be interesting i i don't i agree that i don't think that
[noise]
[noise] okay uh mandatory service yeah i don't think it's a good idea
uh because we'd have to change the constitution to [vocalized-noise] to uh allow uh involuntary servitude uh in service to the government
and i'm not sure that we could do that in such a way that we could avoid winding up a slave state
uh-huh
it's i like the idea
and in what way are you talking about
well [noise] i like the idea of volun- voluntary support i mean they might be able to ah say that anyone who does that uh gets certain benefits that [noise] would not be available to someone who didn't do it
right
but to use force um really sets us a a it it essentially says that your body there's a title to your body and that title belongs to the government and you are not a free american citizen
r- yeah right
the idea itself of service is good
and when someone is say out of high school and not sure about college or out of college and not ready to go into a career and they're not committed to huge amounts of debt that's the best time to be able to do work that doesn't pay very well
see i- i yeah and i also thought that um that would interfere with with college work and
yeah unless it were tied directly
[vocalized-noise] they didn't
[noise] yeah
you know if someone were studying something uh let's say take something obscure somebody was studying economics the state department could offer to send them to the soviet union for two years to teach them how to run their country
yeah that's true
[laughter] as an extreme example right
yeah [laughter]
but in reality i think what you would wind up with is a political football where they would see all these body counts that they can use to for their own will and i just don't think it would work
when do they assume this is gonna be proposed or mandatory or when when i what what year are they looking at
well they're not it's been suggested and it's sort of a topic of debate every time it comes up it gets voted down the uh people who are pro-military oppose it because they don't want people to have the right to opt out of the military into something else
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
and the people who are pro-constitution oppose it on the grounds that the government shouldn't even have the right to enforce you to join the military unless the united states is actually under attack
yeah
right
[noise] so mostly it's just kind of one of those things that goes away [noise] ah they've got a noisy line
right
yeah
i thought that was your line [laughter]
yeah well it's somewhere between here and there
uh what age group i- are are they looking at
uh oh eighteen the draft age yeah [noise] wait a min- yeah [noise] let me see if i can get on a cleaner line if it's my line um [noise]
eighteen yeah that seems normally that would interfere with college i would think
i moved maybe that is that's part of it
[noise] yeah it is my line i was on a radio phone
oh
all right that's better yeah no there they they figure that they can draft you at eighteen age they usually do draft you at nineteen and that's the age they're looking at
oh hm
and of course they're this one the women would be equally grabbed and they're almost on the verge of saying that you if you're gonna draft men you're gonna have to draft women and you're gonna have to put them in front of the guns just the same
right
so uh if you're near that age or you know somebody who is uh you know be aware of that
um-hum
yeah
well that's kind of scary [laughter] i'm not near that age [laughter] i'm way over it but i do have children to think about you know [noise]
yeah
oh okay
yep and you don't want them sent off to the middle east to help defend bush from saddam after bush gets done arming him
that's kind of scary
right
you know we only find out about that a year after the fact
yeah
so it's another thing when in doubt don't trust the government at all it's really reached that point
oh uh-huh hm
hey you're in perot country i'm really thinking that this guy might be good for us
[noise] i do too [laughter]
i've been it it seemed dangerous i thought is the guy a closet fascist and then i find out that he helped rid the united states of the gablers
[noise] he's he's helped out in a lot of ways yeah he's he's from dallas or he's in the dallas area and uh he's very well known around here so
yeah
[vocalized-noise] well i'm in the computer biz too so i know he's well known in the industry they uh i- i have high hopes for him and i think that you know if he could get people interested and encouraged and to believe that the government was actually for us then i'm for him
uh-huh
yeah i- i
i mean in the democratic primary i'm gonna vote for brown just because i kind of like brown and his attitude but when uh when it really comes down in the fall i think i know where it's gonna go
yeah yeah i- i think he's got a very good chance so there's a lot of people here pulling for him
um-hum
so [noise]
i don't know [laughter] we'll just see how did you uh [vocalized-noise] you work in the um computer business that what you said
yeah
you know this
yeah i'm an end user i teach people how to use macintoshes and how to buy equipment and desktop publishing magazine production and things related to that
oh okay well my husband works for um texas instruments and so um that's how we found out about the switchboard
uh-huh
oh yeah oh that's their project too isn't it i found about it on the network
[vocalized-noise]
[noise] well my exercise program consists of uh you know it's it's a it's an opportunity to stay alive really
[noise]
hm
instead of w- you know wasting my my [vocalized-noise] you know the the trying to exist on the latency of my youth an- th- good health of my youth and i- what i like to do is i like to stretch out
and i like to run uh m- i'm like to run get my heartbeat up
i like to run about oh about two two and a half miles and then i like to work out on uh on the uh uh the bailey life c- uh cycle machines up here at the a- at the holiday spa
and and and i- i think that you know i've had a regimen now for about you know ten fifteen years of of doing that
and uh and you know i kind of think it's uh it's a lot of work but i think it's uh it's the uh you know the the amount of effort that's required
to uh to stay healthy you know i have a sedentary job and uh unless you do something like that you know you're going to get sick
right yeah i'm i need to get i- i'm i'm pretty bad about that i'm lazy i should i know i want i always say that i need to get runn- start running and i going to try and do that this summer
because i never have time i- i always put it off by the time i get back from classes it's late at night and i don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever because i i'm i'm getting a gut here i got to get get back into shape
well i uh two years ago i started having trouble with my knee
and uh you know i've got a you know i figured well it'll go away well i st- you know i'm i've had to reduce my program reduce my program and i've gained fifteen pounds
hm
and so uh you know it's y- you know i need to get back into swimming you know in- instead of running if i can't swim or i can't run i should be able to swim
well i'm such a terrible swimmer and i- i- i really feel i can i can dedicate about an hour an hour and fifteen minutes f- to this effort but if it gets longer than that i- i it it i start not doing anything
yeah
and so i- i got a real problem in that regard
uh it do you you obviously are are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it
yeah i mean i-
i do it i guess i'm going to do it um because i want to get in shape
i'm not it's not something i really enjoy all that much although i'll i'll i'll probably i mean once i get into it and i if i if i get into better shape then it'll be it won't be as much of a a chore to me
well it's it's always a chore i- i mean i started doing this when i was about thirty five and now i'm fifty five
yeah
hm
yeah
and uh you know i- i know that in [vocalized-noise] i just know that i'm going to get blown away with some some piece of nonsense y- you know some health related thing is going to blow me away that's same way i got too much weight on right now
right
i need to lose fifty pounds you know i need to lose at least twenty you know but uh you know it's it's just uh i'm busy i'm doing a lot of traveling and uh i- it creates a problem uh you know when you're on the road
what sort of uh uh w- w- what other programs other than say running have y- have you ever done anything at all
yeah i have um
sit-ups or al- also last summer i was doing nautilus or last year
[noise] i um belong to a club around here got kind of expensive uh to re- to re- renew they wanted another fifty dollars that was a little bit too much money but um doing a mix of nautilus and free weights
um-hum
well what club what club are you with
i like that
i'm sorry
what club were you with
uh it's called oh what was it called [laughter] city sports downtown washington
huh
okay so you're you're down you're downtown
yeah i'm at i'm at i go to george washington university
okay yeah you're down there on you know twentieth and eighteenth and
yeah
f. g.
it's [vocalized-noise] uh plaza
oh
well i'd uh well there's a there's a holiday spa down there on on k. street i think something like that
but uh i- i go to the holiday spa here in alexandria and that's pretty good but you know evening time it gets pretty busy
but generally you know i can i can get in and get a program in
right
but uh you know i- i need to i need to rededicate myself to uh to doing this and uh i got a problem uh you know ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it i mean i've been doing this for fifteen twenty years
yeah
and you know and i'm i know i'm going to get i know it's going to bite me in the ass so i- i really don't want to want to uh you know back off on it
yeah it's something i it's like uh i'm young and i should get started getting into shape i don't want to at one i mean one point it's going to be too late to do it like
well no when you're young you you can abuse your your all your systems and you can recover
[noise]
yeah
uh when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away
hm
and just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye
you know and uh and so the object of the game
[noise]
[noise]
why don't you start
oh i don't know i um
[noise] i refinished a couple of
old uh dressers that were gi- handed down you know it's nice tongue and groove um
uh construction
uh [noise]
huh that's just i've been pretty successful with that [noise] [vocalized-noise]
things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that
what
are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing
no i've done some other things too um you know
i've yeah i've done both [noise] uh i have had my wife's picked up a couple things saying uh boy if we could refinish that that'd be a [noise] beautiful piece of furniture and uh and we've done it a couple of times
yeah
i guess tha- we've been fairly successful with those that's uh that's a kind of low risk sort of project isn't it i guess
oh yeah
yeah that's a good way to get started
um i have a a um really nice desk a nicer desk than i could afford which i got because my sister who worked in a hospital uh liberated it after a fire and uh
um-hum
we stripped it all the way down and refinished it it turned out to be really nice uh pretty nice desk maple top i think or
um-hum
[noise]
um-hum
or something of that sort
yeah i i put together um a um rolltop desk from scratch you know a kit
oh really
oh i'm jealous
still had to cut it and everything but yeah it's fun
uh-huh
yeah [noise] i've i do do things uh that
might be too crude to be called woodworking i've built my own deck and
uh-huh
um [noise] things like that [vocalized-noise]
yeah i've i've done the same you know like the trim around the house you know the baseboards and things like that
and i [noise]
i definitely have begun to accumulate tools too my i uh
i picked up a bunch of craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive and so i do have a band saw and a router and um things like that out in the garage but i can't say i use them very often
uh-huh [noise]
[noise]
um i i'm looking at trying to get a router right now
they're handy uh they they come in handy at the most unusual times putting doors in is the time when i'm uh i bought myself a um
[vocalized-noise]
template for making mortices and doors and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel
[laughter]
[laughter] but i've also i've also used them for building drawers where you uh for rabbeting and uh
i'll bet
because uh rabbeting on my table on my uh radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain [laughter]
um-hum
so i got one for christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months i had it and now i- i use it twice a year maybe
yeah my bro- my brothers used it a lot for making drawers
[noise]
the big stu-
i don't know what what's your opinion of what a good router is like
[noise] uh i guess it
you know i ha-
because he was tell me like the ones that you dial in aren't all that great they've plastic parts and stuff
[noise] the ones that what
that you dial in on the side
uh i have never even s- i've never even looked at one closely and the the little use that i've gotten from my router i would say
um-hum
uh i would spend my money on the bits [laughter]
uh-huh
um i have a i'd guess you'd call a medium quality craftsman router and the um
how strong is it
[noise]
it's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than say three eighths of an inch at a time
but the problem is that the uh as with any any time you buy um a a tool with a- a- as a as a package the bits that they give you are low end
don't they um-hum
um-hum
[laughter]
[noise] so [vocalized-noise] the price of a good set of uh carbide steel uh bits is probably um i mean a a good set of bits is probably gonna run you a hundred dollars and uh um
if you're gonna use it for a lifetime i suppose it's worth it because [vocalized-noise] um imagine if i go and sharpen them myself uh it won't last
[noise] and i've never had the bits sharpened
uh-huh
so that's a thing to consider is to
they they really get hot don't they
yeah and they they dull after a while especially i did some cabinets in um ash and oak and uh that that wears a bit down
uh-huh
we remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets uh which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen
uh-huh
right
[noise] and i saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth [noise] and
uh routing hardwood will um take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast so
yeah i've cut some one by eight oak before
[laughter]
boy was that fun big solid pieces of oak are just tough
right that's uh
and then you take the blade to the to get sharpened right [laughter]
[laughter]
[noise]
well that was you know with a with a circular saw like oh my gosh this gonna be fun
uh-huh
right
yeah
[laughter]
[noise] well i've used mine on treated wood and now all my blades need sharpening
yeah
because uh the treated wood will also chew them up
yeah treated wood can really make you sick too if you're no-
[noise] okay
[noise]
okay carol
so air quality
yeah is it i know in here uh downtown dallas it's you i mean you drive by and you can just
you can see it [laughter] but then again [noise] i w- originally was from california and uh there is a big difference between texas and california
uh-huh
surely
and uh they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner and of course they don't have that here in texas
so there's
you mean they don't have the uh the smog alerts
no not in not in te- not well not in dallas that is
right i- i yeah i spent a summer in in in tyler
[noise]
so i know
just east of dallas there
yeah we're going there tomorrow uh-huh [laughter] we're packing and getting ready to go to [vocalized-noise]
oh really
yeah
actually i'm a california born person
uh-huh
i was born in l._a. so i know what you're talking about in l._a. it's pretty bad
yeah oh okay yeah you do then
[noise]
um the worst city in the in the world is actually uh mexico city
is it really i would not imagine that
yes
the worst one for smog is mexico city
huh
the most polluted city in the world
[laughter]
huh you learn something every day
is that crazy
yeah i know that they've they're looking at uh um
you know uh you know better running automobiles [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh yeah i've seen that
um
some things they do o- o- one one of them is they're using corn in fuel
huh i huh-uh
you ever heard of that yeah methanol
huh no
yeah well that's big up here because of the [noise] they grow a lot of corn
oh yeah [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
uh
yeah that's one thing that they do and a- at that it's pretty easy to do and the uh
uh-huh
unfortunately it still contributes to global warming cause you have to w- you know wipe out forest to grow corn and things like that it doesn't make sense
yeah that's true
uh [noise] but it's you know one of the most uh productive crop in the world is corn
right
huh
and of course i doubt if there's any you can buy regular anymore you buy unleaded right
yeah
yeah
huh
drive cars with catalytic converters and all that
[noise]
it's interesting they're they're looking at at
there's some work being done on uh automobiles that are electric powered
uh-huh
and uh they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically but it has a a engine in the back that charges it so the engine kicks on when the batteries need power and it turns off
uh-huh
uh-huh
interesting thing about gas is when i mean about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light you're not using ener- any energy
huh that is good
[vocalized-noise] unlike a car where it's running
yeah
electric car it's on demand i mean it's either on or off basically
yeah
huh
you don't have to shift [laughter]
[laughter]
so you cars become very simple all of a sudden too
oh
oh
ve- interesting
that would be nice
i think i saw that on t._v. one time they maybe it was c._n._n. where they were demonstrating that or something similar to that
yeah
there's a there's a race in australia with solar powered cars
oh
and ford and general motors and all tho- compete
but what w- w- i think that was a s- a a setback that they i don't know they went i don't know how many miles an hour i think like twenty
right
w- was that something maybe it was i don't know
yeah g._m. uh chrysler announced that they're going to they're well they actually have an electric minivan
oh
yeah their their caravan
huh
but it costs uh fifty thousand dollars right n-
[laughter] yeah and they're they're very expensive too
i was gonna [vocalized-noise]
to operate yeah
but you know people are buying them you know whose buying them the power company
[laughter]
free you know free for them
well yeah yeah
kind of interesting so see
well it doesn't make sense because if they want people to convert you know
uh-huh
they should make it worthwhile
yeah it's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour so it's a good good vehicle
yeah yeah hum
well i'll tell you sometimes it's it's pretty bad here t- like today i think it was pretty bad i don't know if it was if it's just uh allergies or what but
uh-huh
some days it's r- it's very nice here downtown and other days it's just really bad
so
i don't know
so what what kind of things did you experience in l._a. when you were there or can you remember were you there at a
oh i wasn't there too long ago um
cause i haven't been there probably
well you know y- going over the hills you know coming into the valley you can see that horrible horrible brown haze
yeah
well we were there when they had a
